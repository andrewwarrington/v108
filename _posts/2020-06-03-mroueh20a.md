title: Wasserstein Style Transfer
abstract: 'We propose Gaussian optimal transport for image style transfer in an Encoder/Decoder
  framework. Optimal transport for Gaussian measures has closed forms Monge mappings
  from source to target distributions. Moreover, interpolating between a content and
  a style image can be seen as geodesics in the  Wasserstein Geometry. Using this
  insight, we show how to mix different target styles , using Wasserstein barycenter
  of Gaussian measures. Since Gaussians are closed under Wasserstein barycenter, this
  allows us a simple style transfer and style mixing and interpolation. Moreover we
  show how mixing different styles can be achieved using other geodesic metrics between
  gaussians such as the Fisher Rao metric, while the transport of the content to the
  new interpolate style is still performed with Gaussian OT maps. Our simple methodology
  allows to generate new stylized content interpolating between many artistic styles.
  The metric used in the interpolation results in different stylizations. A demo is
  available on https: //wasserstein-transfer.github.io.'
