title: Simulator Calibration under Covariate Shift with Kernels
abstract: We propose a novel calibration method for computer simulators, dealing with
  the problem of covariate shift.Covariate shift is the situation where input distributions
  for training and test are different, and ubiquitous in applications of simulations.
  Our approach is based on Bayesian inference with kernel mean embedding of distributions,
  and on the use of an importance-weighted reproducing kernel for covariate shift
  adaptation.We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed method, including
  a novel theoretical result for conditional mean embedding, as well as empirical
  investigations suggesting its effectiveness in practice.The experiments include
  calibration of a widely used simulator for industrial manufacturing processes, where
  we also demonstrate how the proposed method may be useful for sensitivity analysis
  of model parameters.
