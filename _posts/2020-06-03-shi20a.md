title: Decentralized Multi-player Multi-armed Bandits with No Collision Information
abstract: The decentralized stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandit (MP-MAB) problem,
  where the collision information is not available to the players, is studied in this
  paper. Building on the seminal work of Boursier and Perchet (2019), we propose error
  correction synchronization involving communication (EC-SIC), whose regret is shown
  to approach that of the centralized stochastic MP-MAB with collision information.
  By recognizing that the communication phase without collision information corresponds
  to the Z-channel model in information theory, the proposed EC-SIC algorithm applies
  optimal error correction coding for the communication of reward statistics. A fixed
  message length, as opposed to the logarithmically growing one in Boursier and Perchet
  (2019), also plays a crucial role in controlling the communication loss. Experiments
  with practical Z-channel codes, such as repetition code, flip code and modified
  Hamming code, demonstrate the superiority of EC-SIC in both synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
