title: Deep Structured Mixtures of Gaussian Processes
abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian regression
  models that allow exact posterior inference, but exhibit high computational and
  memory costs. In order to improve scalability of GPs, approximate posterior inference
  is frequently employed, where a prominent class of approximation techniques is based
  on local GP experts. However, local-expert techniques proposed so far are either
  not well-principled, come with limited approximation guarantees, or lead to intractable
  models. In this paper, we introduce deep structured mixtures of GP experts, a stochastic
  process model which i) allows exact posterior inference, ii) has attractive computational
  and memory costs, and iii) when used as GP approximation, captures predictive uncertainties
  consistently better than previous expert-based approximations. In a variety of experiments,
  we show that deep structured mixtures have a low approximation error and often perform
  competitive or outperform prior work.
