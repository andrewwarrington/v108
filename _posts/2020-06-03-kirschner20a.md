title: Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization
abstract: Robustness to distributional shift is one of the key challenges of contemporary
  machine learning. Attaining such robustness is the goal of distributionally robust
  optimization, which seeks a solution to an optimization problem that is worst-case
  robust under a specified distributional shift of an uncontrolled covariate. In this
  paper, we study such a problem when the distributional shift is measured via the
  maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). For the setting of zeroth-order, noisy optimization,
  we present a novel distributionally robust Bayesian optimization algorithm (DRBO).
  Our algorithm provably obtains sub-linear robust regret in various settings that
  differ in how the uncertain covariate is observed. We demonstrate the robust performance
  of our method on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
