title: An Optimal Algorithm for Adversarial Bandits with Arbitrary Delays
abstract: We propose a new algorithm for adversarial multi-armed bandits with unrestricted
  delays. The algorithm is based on a novel hybrid regularizer applied in the Follow
  the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework. It achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{kn}+\sqrt{D\log(k)})$
  regret guarantee, where $k$ is the number of arms, $n$ is the number of rounds,
  and $D$ is the total delay. The result matches the lower bound within constants
  and requires no prior knowledge of $n$ or $D$. Additionally, we propose a refined
  tuning of the algorithm, which achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{kn}+\min_{S}(|S|+\sqrt{D_{\bar
  S}\log(k)}))$ regret guarantee, where $S$ is a set of rounds excluded from delay
  counting, $\bar S = [n]\setminus S$ are the counted rounds, and $D_{\bar S}$ is
  the total delay in the counted rounds. If the delays are highly unbalanced, the
  latter regret guarantee can be significantly tighter than the former. The result
  requires no advance knowledge of the delays and resolves an open problem of Thune
  et al. (2019). The new FTRL algorithm and its refined tuning are anytime and require
  no doubling, which resolves another open problem of Thune et al. (2019).
