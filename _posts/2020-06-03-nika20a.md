title: Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Multi-armed Bandit with Adaptive Discretization
abstract: We consider contextual combinatorial volatile multi-armed bandit (CCV-MAB),
  in which at each round, the learner observes a set of available base arms and their
  contexts, and then, selects a super arm that contains $K$ base arms in order to
  maximize its cumulative reward. Under the semi-bandit feedback setting and assuming
  that the contexts lie in a space ${\cal X}$ endowed with the Euclidean norm and
  that the expected base arm outcomes (expected rewards) are Lipschitz continuous
  in the contexts (expected base arm outcomes), we propose an algorithm called Adaptive
  Contextual Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound (ACC-UCB). This algorithm, which
  adaptively discretizes ${\cal X}$ to form estimates of base arm outcomes and uses
  an $\alpha$-approximation oracle as a subroutine to select a super arm in each round,
  achieves $\tilde{O} ( T^{(\bar{D}+1)/(\bar{D}+2) + \epsilon}  )$ regret for any
  $\epsilon>0$, where $\bar{D}$ represents the approximate optimality dimension related
  to ${\cal X}$. This dimension captures both the benignness of the base arm arrivals
  and the structure of the expected reward. In addition, we provide a recipe for obtaining
  more optimistic regret bounds by taking into account the volatility of the base
  arms and show that ACC-UCB achieves significant performance gains compared to the
  state-of-the-art for worker selection in mobile crowdsourcing.
