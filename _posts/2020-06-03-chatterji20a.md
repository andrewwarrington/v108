title: Langevin Monte Carlo without smoothness
abstract: Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is an iterative algorithm used to generate samples
  from a distribution that is known only up to a normalizing constant. The nonasymptotic
  dependence of its mixing time on the dimension and target accuracy is understood
  mainly in the setting of smooth (gradient-Lipschitz) log-densities, a serious limitation
  for applications in machine learning. In this paper, we remove this limitation,
  providing polynomial-time convergence guarantees for a variant of LMC in the setting
  of nonsmooth log-concave distributions. At a high level, our results follow by leveraging
  the implicit smoothing of the log-density that comes from a small  Gaussian perturbation
  that we add to the iterates of the algorithm and controlling the bias and variance
  that are induced by this perturbation.
