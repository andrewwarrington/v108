title: 'Explaining the Explainer: A First Theoretical Analysis of LIME'
abstract: 'Machine learning is used more and more often for sensitive applications,
  sometimes replacing humans in critical decision-making processes. As such, interpretability
  of these algorithms is a pressing need. One popular algorithm to provide interpretability
  is LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation). In this paper, we provide
  the first theoretical analysis of LIME. We derive closed-form expressions for the
  coefficients of the interpretable model when the function to explain is linear.
  The good news is that these coefficients are proportional to the gradient of the
  function to explain: LIME indeed discovers meaningful features. However, our analysis
  also reveals that poor choices of parameters can lead LIME to miss important features.  '
