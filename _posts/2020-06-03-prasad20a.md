title: A Robust Univariate Mean Estimator is All You Need
abstract: We study the problem of designing estimators when the data has heavy-tails
  and is corrupted by outliers. In such an adversarial setup, we aim to design statistically
  optimal estimators for flexible non-parametric distribution classes such as distributions
  with bounded-2k moments and symmetric distributions. Our primary workhorse is a
  conceptually simple reduction from multivariate estimation to univariate estimation.
  Using this reduction, we design estimators which are optimal in both heavy-tailed
  and contaminated settings. Our estimators achieve an optimal dimension independent
  bias in the contaminated setting, while also simultaneously achieving high-probability
  error guarantees with optimal sample complexity. These results provide some of the
  first such estimators for a broad range of problems including Mean Estimation, Sparse
  Mean Estimation, Covariance Estimation, Sparse Covariance Estimation and Sparse
  PCA.
