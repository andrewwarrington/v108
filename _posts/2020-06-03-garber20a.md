title: Improved Regret Bounds for Projection-free Bandit Convex Optimization
abstract: We revisit the challenge of designing online algorithms for the bandit convex
  optimization problem (BCO) which are also scalable to high dimensional problems.
  Hence, we consider algorithms that are \textit{projection-free}, i.e., based on
  the conditional gradient method whose only access to the feasible decision set,
  is through a linear optimization oracle (as opposed to other methods which require
  potentially much more computationally-expensive subprocedures, such as computing
  Euclidean projections). We present the first such algorithm that attains $O(T^{3/4})$
  expected regret using only $O(T)$ overall calls to the linear optimization oracle,
  in expectation, where $T$ in the number of prediction rounds. This improves over
  the $O(T^{4/5})$ expected regret bound recently obtained by  \cite{Karbasi19}, and
  actually matches the current best regret bound for projection-free online learning
  in the \textit{full information} setting.
