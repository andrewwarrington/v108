title: Persistence Enhanced Graph Neural Network
abstract: Local structural information can increase the adaptability of graph convolutional
  networks to large graphs with heterogeneous topology. Existing methods only use
  relatively simplistic topological information, such as node degrees.We present a
  novel approach leveraging advanced topological information, i.e., persistent homology,
  which measures the information flow efficiency at different parts of the graph.
  To fully exploit such structural information in real world graphs, we propose a
  new network architecture which learns to use persistent homology information to
  reweight messages passed between graph nodes during convolution. For node classification
  tasks, our network outperforms existing ones on a broad spectrum of graph benchmarks.
