title: Convergence Rates of Smooth Message Passing with Rounding in Entropy-Regularized
  MAP Inference
abstract: Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is a fundamental computational paradigm
  for statistical inference. In the setting of graphical models, MAP inference entails
  solving a combinatorial optimization problem to find the most likely configuration
  of the discrete-valued model. Linear programming (LP) relaxations in the Sherali-Adams
  hierarchy are widely used to attempt to solve this problem, and smooth message passing
  algorithms have been proposed to solve regularized versions of these LPs with great
  success. This paper leverages recent work in entropy-regularized LPs to analyze
  convergence rates of a class of edge-based smooth message passing algorithms to
  epsilon-optimality in the relaxation. With an appropriately chosen regularization
  constant, we present a theoretical guarantee on the number of iterations sufficient
  to recover the true integral MAP solution when the LP is tight and the solution
  is unique.
