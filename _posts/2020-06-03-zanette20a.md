title: Frequentist Regret Bounds for Randomized Least-Squares Value Iteration
abstract: We consider the exploration-exploitation dilemma in finite-horizon reinforcement
  learning (RL). When the state space is large or continuous, traditional tabular
  approaches are unfeasible and some form of function approximation is mandatory.
  In this paper, we introduce an optimistically-initialized variant of the popular
  randomized least-squares value iteration (RLSVI), a model-free algorithm where exploration
  is induced by perturbing the least-squares approximation of the action-value function.
  Under the assumption that the Markov decision process has low-rank transition dynamics,
  we prove that the frequentist regret of RLSVI is upper-bounded by $\widetilde O(d^2
  H^2 \sqrt{T})$ where $ d $ are the feature dimension, $ H $ is the horizon, and
  $ T $ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  frequentist regret analysis for randomized exploration with function approximation.
