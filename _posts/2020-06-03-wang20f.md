title: Assessing Local Generalization Capability in Deep Models
abstract: 'While it has not yet been proven, empirical evidence suggests that model
  generalization is related to local properties of the optima, which can be described
  via the Hessian. We connect model generalization with the local property of a solution
  under the PAC-Bayes paradigm. In particular, we prove that model generalization
  ability is related to the Hessian, the higher-order â€œsmoothness" terms characterized
  by the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian, and the scales of the parameters. Guided
  by the proof, we propose a metric to score the generalization capability of a model,
  as well as an algorithm that optimizes the perturbed model accordingly. '
