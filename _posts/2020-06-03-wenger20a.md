title: Non-Parametric Calibration for Classification
abstract: Many applications of classification methods not only require high accuracy
  but also reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty. However, while many current
  classification frameworks, in particular deep neural networks, achieve high accuracy,
  they tend to incorrectly estimate uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a method
  that adjusts the confidence estimates of a general classifier such that they approach
  the probability of classifying correctly. In contrast to existing approaches, our
  calibration method employs a non-parametric representation using a latent Gaussian
  process, and is specifically designed for multi-class classification. It can be
  applied to any classifier that outputs confidence estimates and is not limited to
  neural networks. We also provide a theoretical analysis regarding the over- and
  underconfidence of a classifier and its relationship to calibration, as well as
  an empirical outlook for calibrated active learning. In experiments we show the
  universally strong performance of our method across different classifiers and benchmark
  data sets, in particular for state-of-the art neural network architectures.
