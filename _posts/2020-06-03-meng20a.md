title: 'Fast and Furious Convergence: Stochastic Second Order Methods under Interpolation'
abstract: We consider stochastic second-order methods for minimizing smooth and strongly-convex
  functions under an interpolation condition satisfied by over-parameterized models.
  Under this condition, we show that the regularized subsampled Newton method (R-SSN)
  achieves global linear convergence with an adaptive step-size and a constant batch-size.
  By growing the batch size for both the subsampled gradient and Hessian, we show
  that R-SSN can converge at a quadratic rate in a local neighbourhood of the solution.
  We also show that R-SSN attains local linear convergence for the family of self-concordant
  functions. Furthermore, we analyze stochastic BFGS algorithms in the interpolation
  setting and prove their global linear convergence. We empirically evaluate stochastic
  L-BFGS and a "Hessian-free" implementation of R-SSN for binary classification on
  synthetic, linearly-separable datasets and real datasets under a kernel mapping.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the fast convergence of these methods, both
  in terms of the number of iterations and wall-clock time.
