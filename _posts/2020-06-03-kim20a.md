title: 'Recommendation on a Budget: Column Space Recovery from Partially Observed
  Entries with Random or Active Sampling'
abstract: We analyze alternating minimization for column space recovery of a partially
  observed, approximately low rank matrix with a growing number of columns and a fixed
  budget of observations per column. We prove that if the budget is greater than the
  rank of the matrix, column space recovery succeeds â€“ as the number of columns grows,
  the estimate from alternating minimization converges to the true column space with
  probability tending to one. From our proof techniques, we naturally formulate an
  active sampling strategy for choosing entries of a column that is theoretically
  and empirically (on synthetic and real data) better than the commonly studied uniformly  random
  sampling strategy.
