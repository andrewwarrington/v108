title: Unsupervised Hierarchy Matching with Optimal Transport over Hyperbolic Spaces
abstract: 'This paper focuses on the problem of unsupervised alignment of hierarchical
  data such as ontologies or lexical databases. This problem arises across areas,
  from natural language processing to bioinformatics, and is typically solved by appeal
  to outside knowledge bases and label-textual similarity. In contrast, we approach
  the problem from a purely geometric perspective: given only a vector-space representation
  of the items in the two hierarchies, we seek to infer correspondences across them.
  Our work derives from and interweaves hyperbolic-space representations for hierarchical
  data, on one hand, and unsupervised word-alignment methods, on the other. We first
  provide a set of negative results showing how and why Euclidean methods fail in
  this hyperbolic setting. We then propose a novel approach based on optimal transport
  over hyperbolic spaces, and show that it outperforms standard embedding alignment
  techniques in various experiments on cross-lingual WordNet alignment and ontology
  matching tasks. '
