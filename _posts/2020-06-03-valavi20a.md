title: Revisiting the Landscape of Matrix Factorization
abstract: Prior work has shown that low-rank matrix factorization has infinitely many
  critical points, each of which is either a global minimum or a (strict) saddle point.
  We revisit this problem and provide simple, intuitive proofs of a set of extended
  results for low-rank and general-rank problems. We couple our investigation with
  a known invariant manifold M0 of gradient flow. This restriction admits a uniform
  negative upper bound on the least eigenvalue of the Hessian map at all strict saddles
  in M0. The bound depends on the size of the nonzero singular values and the separation
  between distinct singular values of the matrix to be factorized.
