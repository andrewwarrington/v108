title: Contextual Online False Discovery Rate Control
abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing, a situation when we wish to consider many hypotheses,
  is a core problem in statistical inference that arises in almost every scientific
  field. In this setting, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the
  expected proportion of type I error, is an important challenge for making meaningful
  inferences. In this paper, we consider a setting where an ordered (possibly infinite)
  sequence of hypotheses arrives in a stream, and for each hypothesis we observe a
  p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. The decision whether
  or not to reject the current hypothesis must be made immediately at each time step,
  before the next hypothesis is observed. This model provides a general way of leveraging
  the side (contextual) information in the data to help maximize the number of discoveries
  while controlling the FDR.We propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures,
  where the rejection thresholds are learned sequentially by incorporating contextual
  information and previous results. We prove that any rule in this class controls
  online FDR under some standard assumptions. We then focus on a subclass of these
  procedures, based on weighting the rejection thresholds, to derive a practical algorithm
  that learns a parametric weight function in an online fashion to gain more discoveries.
  We also theoretically prove that our proposed procedures, under some easily verifiable
  assumptions, would lead to an increase of statistical power over a popular online
  testing procedure proposed by Javanmard and Montanari (2018). Finally, we demonstrate
  the superior performance of our procedure, by comparing it to state-of-the-art online
  multiple testing procedures, on both synthetic data and real data generated from
  different applications.
