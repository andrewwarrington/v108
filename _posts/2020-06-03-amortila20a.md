title: A Distributional Analysis of Sampling-Based Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
abstract: We present a distributional approach to theoretical analyses of reinforcement
  learning algorithms for constant step-sizes. We demonstrate its effectiveness by
  presenting simple and unified proofs of convergence for a variety of commonly-used
  methods. We show that value-based methods such as TD(?) and Q-Learning have update
  rules which are contractive in the space of distributions of functions, thus establishing
  their exponentially fast convergence to a stationary distribution. We demonstrate
  that the stationary distribution obtained by any algorithm whose target is an expected
  Bellman update has a mean which is equal to the true value function. Furthermore,
  we establish that the distributions concentrate around their mean as the step-size
  shrinks. We further analyse the optimistic policy iteration algorithm, for which
  the contraction property does not hold, and formulate a probabilistic policy improvement
  property which entails the convergence of the algorithm.
