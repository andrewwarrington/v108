title: Validated Variational Inference via Practical Posterior Error Bounds
abstract: Variational inference has become an increasingly attractive fast alternative
  to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for approximate Bayesian inference. However,
  a major obstacle to the widespread use of variational methods is the lack of post-hoc
  accuracy measures that are both theoretically justified and computationally efficient.
  In this paper, we provide rigorous bounds on the error of posterior mean and uncertainty
  estimates that arise from full-distribution approximations, as in variational inference.
  Our bounds are widely applicable, as they require only that the approximating and
  exact posteriors have polynomial moments. Our bounds are also computationally efficient
  for variational inference because they require only standard values from variational
  objectives, straightforward analytic calculations, and simple Monte Carlo estimates.
  We show that our analysis naturally leads to a new and improved workflow for validated
  variational inference. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our proposed workflow
  and error bounds on a robust regression problem and on a real-data example with
  a widely used multilevel hierarchical model.
