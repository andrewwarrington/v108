title: Stopping criterion for active learning based on deterministic generalization
  bounds
abstract: Active learning is a framework in which the learning machine can select
  the samples to be used for training. This technique is promising, particularly when
  the cost of data acquisition and labeling is high. In active learning, determining
  the timing at which learning should be stopped is a critical issue. In this study,
  we propose a criterion for automatically stopping active learning. The proposed
  stopping criterion is based on the difference in the expected generalization errors
  and hypothesis testing. We derive a novel upper bound for the difference in expected
  generalization errors before and after obtaining a new training datum based on PAC-Bayesian
  theory. Unlike ordinary PAC-Bayesian bounds, though, the proposed bound is deterministic;
  hence, there is no uncontrollable trade-off between the confidence and tightness
  of the inequality. We combine the upper bound with a statistical test to derive
  a stopping criterion for active learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method via experiments with both artificial and real datasets.
