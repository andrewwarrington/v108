title: Statistical guarantees for local graph clustering
abstract: Local graph clustering methods aim to find small clusters in very large
  graphs. These methods take as input a graph and a seed node, and they return as
  output a good cluster in a running time that depends on the size of the output cluster
  but that is independent of the size of the input graph. In this paper, we adopt
  a statistical perspective on local graph clustering, and we analyze the performance
  of the l1-regularized PageRank method for the recovery of a single target cluster,
  given a seed node inside the cluster. Assuming the target cluster has been generated
  by a random model, we present two results. In the first, we show that the optimal
  support of l1-regularized PageRank recovers the full target cluster, with bounded
  false positives. In the second, we show that if the seed node is connected solely
  to the target cluster then the optimal support of l1-regularized PageRank recovers
  exactly the target cluster. We also show empirically that l1-regularized PageRank
  has a state-of-the-art performance on many real graphs, demonstrating the superiority
  of the method.
