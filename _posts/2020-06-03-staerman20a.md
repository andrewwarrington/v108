title: 'The Area of the Convex Hull of Sampled Curves: a Robust Functional Statistical
  Depth measure'
abstract: With the ubiquity of sensors in the IoT era, statistical observations are
  becoming increasingly available in the form of massive (multivariate) time-series.
  Formulated as unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, an abundance of applications
  like aviation safety management, the health monitoring of complex infrastructures
  or fraud detection can now rely on such functional data, acquired and stored with
  an ever finer granularity. The concept of \textit{statistical depth}, which reflects
  centrality of an arbitrary observation w.r.t. a statistical population may play
  a crucial role in this regard, anomalies corresponding to observations with ’small’
  depth. Supported by sound theoretical and computational developments in the recent
  decades, it has proven to be extremely useful, in particular in functional spaces.
  However, most approaches documented in the literature consist in evaluating independently
  the centrality of each point forming the time series and consequently exhibit a
  certain insensitivity to possible shape changes.In this paper, we propose a novel
  notion of functional depth based on the area of the convex hull of sampled curves,
  capturing gradual departures from centrality, even beyond the envelope of the data,
  in a natural fashion.We discuss practical relevance of commonly imposed axioms on
  functional depths and investigate which of them are satisfied by the notion of depth
  we promote here. Estimation and computational issues are also adressed and various
  numerical experiments provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach
  proposed.
