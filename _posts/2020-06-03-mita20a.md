title: 'LIBRE: Learning Interpretable Boolean Rule Ensembles'
abstract: We present a novel method—LIBRE—learn an interpretable classifier, which
  materializes as a set of Boolean rules. LIBRE uses an ensemble of bottom-up, weak
  learners operating on a random subset of features, which allows for the learning
  of rules that generalize well on unseen data even in imbalanced settings. Weak learners
  are combined with a simple union so that the final ensemble is also interpretable.
  Experimental results indicate that LIBRE efficiently strikes the right balance between
  prediction accuracy, which is competitive with black-box methods, and interpretability,
  which is often superior to alternative methods from the literature.
