title: Quantitative stability of optimal transport maps and linearization of the 2-Wasserstein
  space
abstract: This work studies an explicit embedding of the set of probability measures
  into a Hilbert space, defined using optimal transport maps from a reference probability
  density. This embedding linearizes to some extent the 2-Wasserstein space and is
  shown to be bi-Hölder continuous. It enables the direct use of generic supervised
  and unsupervised learning algorithms on measure data consistently w.r.t. the Wasserstein
  geometry.
