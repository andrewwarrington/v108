title: 'A Unified Statistically Efficient Estimation Framework for Unnormalized Models '
abstract: 'The parameter estimation of unnormalized models is a challenging problem.
  The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is computationally infeasible for these
  models since normalizing constants are not explicitly calculated. Although some
  consistent estimators have been proposed earlier, the problem of statistical efficiency
  remains. In this study, we propose a unified, statistically efficient estimation
  framework for unnormalized models and several efficient estimators, whose asymptotic
  variance is the same as the MLE. The computational cost of these estimators is also
  reasonable and they can be employed whether the sample space is discrete or continuous.
  The loss functions of the proposed estimators are derived by combining the following
  two methods: (1) density-ratio matching using Bregman divergence, and (2) plugging-in
  nonparametric estimators. We also analyze the properties of the proposed estimators
  when the unnormalized models are misspecified. The experimental results demonstrate
  the advantages of our method over existing approaches. '
