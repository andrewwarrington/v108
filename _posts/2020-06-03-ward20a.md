title: Black-Box Inference for Non-Linear Latent Force Models
abstract: Latent force models are systems whereby there is a mechanistic model describing
  the dynamics of the system state, with some unknown forcing term that is approximated
  with a Gaussian process. If such dynamics are non-linear, it can be difficult to
  estimate the posterior state and forcing term jointly, particularly when there are
  system parameters that also need estimating. This paper uses black-box variational
  inference to jointly estimate the posterior, designing a multivariate extension
  to local inverse autoregressive flows as a flexible approximator of the system.
  We compare estimates on systems where the posterior is known, demonstrating the
  effectiveness of the approximation, and apply to problems with non-linear dynamics,
  multi-output systems and models with non-Gaussian likelihoods.
