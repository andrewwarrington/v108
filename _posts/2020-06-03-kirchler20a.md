title: Two-sample Testing Using Deep Learning
abstract: 'We propose a two-sample testing procedure based on learned deep neural
  network representations. To this end, we define two test statistics that perform
  an asymptotic location test on data samples mapped onto a hidden layer. The tests
  are consistent and asymptotically control the type-1 error rate. Their test statistics
  can be evaluated in linear time (in the sample size). Suitable data representations
  are obtained in a data-driven way, by solving a supervised or unsupervised transfer-learning
  task on an auxiliary (potentially distinct) data set. If no auxiliary data is available,
  we split the data into two chunks: one for learning representations and one for
  computing the test statistic. In experiments on audio samples, natural images and
  three-dimensional neuroimaging data our tests yield significant decreases in type-2
  error rate (up to 35 percentage points) compared to state-of-the-art two-sample
  tests such as kernel-methods and classifier two-sample tests.'
