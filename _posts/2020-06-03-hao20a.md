title: Sparse and Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Cubic Sketchings
abstract: " In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse and low-rank
  tensor estimation from cubic sketchings. A two-stage non-convex implementation is
  developed based on sparse tensor decomposition and thresholded gradient descent,
  which ensures exact recovery in the noiseless case and stable recovery in the noisy
  case with high probability. The non-asymptotic analysis sheds light on an interplay
  between optimization error and statistical error. The proposed procedure is shown
  to be rate-optimal under certain conditions. As a technical by-product, novel high-order
  concentration inequalities are derived for studying high-moment sub-Gaussian tensors.
  An interesting tensor formulation illustrates the potential application to high-order
  interaction pursuit in high-dimensional linear regression."
