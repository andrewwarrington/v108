title: 'A Unified Analysis of Extra-gradient and Optimistic Gradient Methods for Saddle
  Point Problems: Proximal Point Approach'
abstract: 'In this paper we consider solving saddle point problems using two variants
  of Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithms, Extra-gradient (EG) and Optimistic Gradient
  Descent Ascent (OGDA) methods. We show that both of these algorithms admit a unified
  analysis as approximations of the classical proximal point method for solving saddle
  point problems. This viewpoint enables us to develop a new framework for analyzing
  EG and OGDA for bilinear and strongly convex-strongly concave settings. Moreover,
  we use the proximal point approximation interpretation to generalize the results
  for OGDA for a wide range of parameters. '
