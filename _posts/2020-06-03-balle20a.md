title: Hypothesis Testing Interpretations and Renyi Differential Privacy
abstract: Differential privacy is a de facto standard in data privacy, with applicationsin
  the public and private sectors. One way of explaining differential privacy,which
  is particularly appealing to statistician and social scientists, is bymeans of its
  statistical hypothesis testing interpretation. Informally, onecannot effectively
  test whether a specific individual has contributed her databy observing the output
  of a private mechanismâ€”any test cannot have bothhigh significance and high power.In
  this paper, we identify some conditions under which a privacy definition given in
  terms of a statistical divergence satisfies a similar interpretation.These conditions
  are useful to analyze the distinguishing power of divergencesand we use them to
  study the hypothesis testing interpretation of somerelaxations of differential privacy
  based on Renyi divergence. Ouranalysis also results in an improved conversion rule
  between these definitionsand differential privacy.
