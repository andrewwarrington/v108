title: Learning Rate Adaptation for Differentially Private Learning
abstract: 'Differentially private learning has recently emerged as the leading approach
  for privacy-preserving machine learning. Differential privacy can complicate learning
  procedures because each access to the data needs to be carefully designed and carries
  a privacy cost. For example, standard parameter tuning with a validation set cannot
  be easily applied. In this paper, we propose a differentially private algorithm
  for the adaptation of the learning rate for differentially private stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) that avoids the need for validation set use. The idea for the adaptiveness
  comes from the technique of extrapolation in numerical analysis: to get an estimate
  for the error against the gradient flow we compare the result obtained by one full
  step and two half-steps. We prove the privacy of the method using the moments accountant
  mechanism. This allows us to compute tight privacy bounds. Empirically we show that
  our method is competitive with manually tuned commonly used optimisation methods
  for training deep neural networks and differentially private variational inference.'
