title: Gaussian Sketching yields a J-L Lemma in RKHS
abstract: 'The main contribution of the paper is to show that Gaussian sketching of
  a kernel-Gram matrix $\bm K$ yields an operator whose counterpart in an RKHS $\cal
  H$, is a \emph{random projection} operator—in the spirit of Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  (J-L) lemma. To be precise, given a random matrix $Z$ with i.i.d. Gaussian entries,
  we show that a sketch $Z\bm{K}$ corresponds to a particular random operator in (infinite-dimensional)
  Hilbert space $\cal H$ that maps functions $f \in \cal H$ to a low-dimensional space
  $\bb R^d$, while preserving a weighted RKHS inner-product of the form $⟨f, g \rangle_{\Sigma}
  \doteq ⟨f, \Sigma^3 g \rangle_{\cal H}$, where $\Sigma$ is the \emph{covariance}
  operator induced by the data distribution. In particular, under similar assumptions
  as in kernel PCA (KPCA), or kernel $k$-means (K-$k$-means), well-separated subsets
  of feature-space $\{K(\cdot, x): x \in \cal X\}$ remain well-separated after such
  operation, which suggests similar benefits as in KPCA and/or K-$k$-means, albeit
  at the much cheaper cost of a random projection. In particular, our convergence
  rates suggest that, given a large dataset $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of size $N$, we can
  build the Gram matrix $\bm K$ on a much smaller subsample of size $n\ll N$, so that
  the sketch $Z\bm K$ is very cheap to obtain and subsequently apply as a projection
  operator on the original data $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^N$.  We verify these insights empirically
  on synthetic data, and on real-world clustering applications.'
