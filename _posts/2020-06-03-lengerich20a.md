title: 'Purifying Interaction Effects with the Functional ANOVA: An Efficient Algorithm
  for Recovering Identifiable Additive Models'
abstract: 'Models which estimate main effects of individual variables alongside interaction
  effects have an identifiability challenge: effects can be freely moved between main
  effects and interaction effects without changing the model prediction. This is a
  critical problem for interpretability because it permits â€œcontradictory" models
  to represent the same function. To solve this problem, we propose pure interaction
  effects: variance in the outcome which cannot be represented by any subset of features.
  This definition has an equivalence with the Functional ANOVA decomposition. To compute
  this decomposition, we present a fast, exact algorithm that transforms any piecewise-constant
  function (such as a tree-based model) into a purified, canonical representation.
  We apply this algorithm to Generalized Additive Models with interactions trained
  on several datasets and show large disparity, including contradictions, between
  the apparent and the purified effects. These results underscore the need to specify
  data distributions and ensure identifiability before interpreting model parameters.'
