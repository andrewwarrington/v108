title: Differentiable Causal Backdoor Discovery
abstract: Discovering the causal effect of a decision is critical to nearly all forms
  of decision-making. In particular, it is a key quantity in drug development, in
  crafting government policy, and when implementing a real-world machine learning
  system. Given only observational data, confounders often obscure the true causal
  effect. Luckily, in some cases, it is possible to recover the causal effect by using
  certain observed variables to adjust for the effects of confounders. However, without
  access to the true causal model, finding this adjustment requires brute-force search.
  In this work, we present an algorithm that exploits auxiliary variables, similar
  to instruments, in order to find an appropriate adjustment by a gradient-based optimization
  method. We demonstrate that it outperforms practical alternatives in estimating
  the true causal effect, without knowledge of the full causal graph.
