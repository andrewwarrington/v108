title: Sparse Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Regression
abstract: 'Feature selection is a fundamental problem for machine learning and statistics,
  and it has been widely studied over the past decades. However, the majority of feature
  selection algorithms are based on linear models, and the nonlinear feature selection
  problem has not been well studied compared to linear models, in particular for the
  high-dimensional case. In this paper, we propose the sparse Hilbertâ€“Schmidt Independence
  Criterion (SpHSIC) regression, which is a versatile nonlinear feature selection
  algorithm based on the HSIC and is a continuous optimization variant of the well-known
  minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. More specifically,
  the SpHSIC consists of two parts: the convex HSIC loss function on the one hand
  and the regularization term on the other hand, where we consider the Lasso, Bridge,
  MCP, and SCAD penalties. We prove that the sparsity based HSIC regression estimator
  satisfies the oracle property; that is, the sparsity-based estimator recovers the
  true underlying sparse model and is asymptotically normally distributed. On the
  basis of synthetic and real-world experiments, we illustrate this theoretical property
  and highlight the fact that the proposed algorithm performs well in the high-dimensional
  setting.'
