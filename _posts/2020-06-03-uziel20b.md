title: Nonparametric Sequential Prediction While Deep Learning the Kernel
abstract: The research on online learning under stationary and ergodic processes has
  been mainly focused on achieving asymptotic guarantees. Although all the methods
  pursue the same asymptotic goal, their performance varies when handling finite sample
  datasets and depends heavily on which predefined density estimation method is chosen.
  In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel algorithm that simultaneously satisfies
  a short-term goal, to perform as good as the best choice in hindsight of a  data-adaptive
  kernel, learned using a deep neural network, and a long-term goal,  to achieve the
  same theoretical asymptotic guarantee. We present theoretical proofs for our algorithms
  and demonstrate the validity of our method on the online portfolio selection problem.
