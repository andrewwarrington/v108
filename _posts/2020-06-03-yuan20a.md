title: Learning Entangled Single-Sample Distributions via Iterative Trimming
abstract: In the setting of entangled single-sample distributions, the goal is to
  estimate some common parameter shared by a family of distributions, given one \emph{single}
  sample from each distribution. We study mean estimation and linear regression under
  general conditions, and analyze a simple and computationally efficient method based
  on iteratively trimming samples and re-estimating the parameter on the trimmed sample
  set. We show that the method in logarithmic iterations outputs an estimation whose
  error only depends on the noise level of the $\lceil \alpha n \rceil$-th noisiest
  data point where $\alpha$ is a constant and $n$ is the sample size. This means it
  can tolerate a constant fraction of high-noise points. These are the first such
  results under our general conditions with computationally efficient estimators.
  It also justifies the wide application and empirical success of iterative trimming
  in practice. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on synthetic
  data.
