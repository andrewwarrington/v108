title: Solving Discounted Stochastic Two-Player Games with Near-Optimal Time and Sample
  Complexity
abstract: In this paper we settle  the sampling complexity of solving discounted two-player
  turn-based zero-sum stochastic games up to polylogarithmic factors. Given a stochastic
  game with discount factor $\gamma\in(0,1)$ we provide an algorithm that computes
  an $\epsilon$-optimal strategy with high-probability given $\tilde{O}((1 - \gamma)^{-3}
  \epsilon^{-2})$ samples from the transition function for each state-action-pair.
  Our algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of samples and uses space
  nearly linear in the number of state-action pairs. As stochastic games generalize
  Markov decision processes (MDPs) our runtime and sample complexities are optimal
  due to \cite{azar2013minimax}. We achieve our results by showing how to generalize
  a near-optimal Q-learning based algorithms for MDP,  in particular \cite{sidford2018near},  to
  two-player strategy computation algorithms. This overcomes limitations of standard
  Q-learning and strategy iteration or alternating minimization based approaches and
  we hope will pave the way for future reinforcement learning results by facilitating
  the extension of MDP results to multi-agent settings with little loss.
