title: A Hybrid Stochastic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We propose a novel hybrid stochastic policy gradient estimator by combining
  an unbiased policy gradient estimator, the REINFORCE estimator, with another biased
  one, an adapted SARAH estimator for policy optimization. The hybrid policy gradient
  estimator is shown to be biased, but has variance reduced property. Using this estimator,
  we develop a new Proximal Hybrid Stochastic Policy Gradient Algorithm (ProxHSPGA)
  to solve a composite policy optimization problem that allows us to handle constraints
  or regularizers on the policy parameters. We first propose a single-looped algorithm
  then introduce a more practical restarting variant. We prove that both algorithms
  can achieve the best-known trajectory complexity to attain a first-order stationary
  point for the composite problem which is better than existing REINFORCE/GPOMDP and
  SVRPG in the non-composite setting. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm
  on several well-known examples in reinforcement learning. Numerical results show
  that our algorithm outperforms two existing methods on these examples. Moreover,
  the composite settings indeed have some advantages compared to the non-composite
  ones on certain problems.
