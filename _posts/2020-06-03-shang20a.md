title: Fixed-confidence guarantees for Bayesian best-arm identification
abstract: 'We investigate and provide new insights on the sampling rule called Top-Two
  Thompson Sampling (TTTS). In particular, we justify its use for fixed-confidence
  best-arm identification. We further propose a variant of TTTS called Top-Two Transportation
  Cost (T3C), which disposes of the computational burden of TTTS. As our main contribution,
  we provide the first sample complexity analysis of TTTS and T3C when coupled with
  a very natural Bayesian stopping rule, for bandits with Gaussian rewards, solving
  one of the open questions raised by Russo (2016). We also provide new posterior
  convergence results for TTTS under two models that are commonly used in practice:
  bandits with Gaussian and Bernoulli rewards and conjugate priors.'
