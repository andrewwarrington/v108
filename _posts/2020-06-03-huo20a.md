title: Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Context-Aware Mobile Activity Recognition
  and Unknown Context Discovery
abstract: 'Activity recognition in wearable computing faces two key challenges: i)
  activity characteristics may be context-dependent and change under different contexts
  or situations; ii) unknown contexts and activities may occur from time to time,
  requiring flexibility and adaptability of the algorithm. We develop a context-aware
  mixture of deep models termed the $\alpha$-$\beta$ network coupled with uncertainty
  quantification (UQ) based upon maximum entropy to enhance human activity recognition
  performance. We improve accuracy and F score by 10% by identifying high-level contexts
  in a data-driven way to guide model development. In order to ensure training stability,
  we have used a clustering-based pre-training in both public and in-house datasets,
  demonstrating improved accuracy through unknown context discovery.'
