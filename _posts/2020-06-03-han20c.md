title: Stein Variational Inference for Discrete Distributions
abstract: Gradient-based approximate inference methods, such as Stein variational
  gradient descent (SVGD) \cite{liu2016stein}, provide simple and general-purpose
  inference engines for differentiable continuous distributions. However, existing
  forms of SVGD can not be directly applied to discrete distributions. In this work,
  we fill this gap by proposing a simple general-purpose framework that transforms
  discrete distributions to equivalent piecewise continuous distribution, on which
  we apply gradient-free Stein variational gradient descent to perform efficient approximate
  inference.  Our empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional algorithms
  such as Gibbs sampling and discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on various challenging
  benchmarks of discrete graphical models. We demonstrate that our method provides
  a promising tool for learning ensembles of binarized neural network (BNN), outperforming
  other widely used ensemble methods on learning binarized AlexNet on CIFAR-10. In
  addition, such transform can be straightforwardly employed in gradient-free kernelized
  Stein discrepancy to perform goodness-of-fit (GOF) test on discrete distributions.
  Our proposed method outperforms existing GOF test methods for intractable discrete
  distributions.
