title: Conditional Linear Regression
abstract: Work in machine learning and statistics commonly focuses on building models
  that capture the vast majority of data, possibly ignoring a segment of the population
  as outliers. However, there may not exist a good, simple model for the distribution,
  so we seek to find a small subset where there exists such a model. We give a computationally
  efficient algorithm with theoretical analysis for the conditional linear regression
  task, which is the joint task of identifying a significant portion of the data distribution,
  described by a k-DNF, along with a linear predictor on that portion with a small
  loss. In contrast to work in robust statistics on small subsets, our loss bounds
  do not feature a dependence on the density of the portion we fit, and compared to
  previous work on conditional linear regression, our algorithmâ€™s running time scales
  polynomially with the sparsity of the linear predictor.  We also demonstrate empirically
  that our algorithm can leverage this advantage to obtain a k-DNF with a better linear
  predictor in practice.
