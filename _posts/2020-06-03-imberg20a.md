title: Optimal sampling in unbiased active learning
abstract: A common belief in unbiased active learning is that, in order to capture
  the most informative instances, the sampling probabilities should be proportional
  to the uncertainty of the class labels. We argue that this produces suboptimal predictions
  and present sampling schemes for unbiased pool-based active learning that minimise
  the actual prediction error, and demonstrate a better predictive performance than
  competing methods on a number of benchmark datasets. In contrast, both probabilistic
  and deterministic uncertainty sampling performed worse than simple random sampling
  on some of the datasets.
