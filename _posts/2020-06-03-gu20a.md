title: 'Fenchel Lifted Networks: A Lagrange Relaxation of Neural Network Training'
abstract: Despite the recent successes of deep neural networks, the corresponding
  training problem remains highly non-convex and difficult to optimize. Classes of
  models have been proposed that introduce greater structure to the objective function
  at the cost of lifting the dimension of the problem. However, these lifted methods
  sometimes perform poorly compared to traditional neural networks. In this paper,
  we introduce a new class of lifted models, Fenchel lifted networks, that enjoy the
  same benefits as previous lifted models, without suffering a degradation in performance
  over classical networks. Our model represents activation functions as equivalent
  biconvex constraints and uses Lagrange Multipliers to arrive at a rigorous lower
  bound of the traditional neural network training problem. This model is efficiently
  trained using block-coordinate descent and is parallelizable across data points
  and/or layers. We compare our model against standard fully connected and convolutional
  networks and show that we are able to match or beat their performance.
