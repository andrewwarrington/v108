title: Linearly Convergent Frank-Wolfe with Backtracking Line-Search
abstract: 'Structured constraints in Machine Learning have recently brought the Frank-Wolfe
  (FW) family of algorithms back in the spotlight. While the classical FW algorithm
  has poor local convergence properties, the Away-steps and Pairwise FW variants have
  emerged as improved variants with faster convergence. However, these improved variants
  suffer from two practical limitations: they require at each iteration to solve a
  1-dimensional minimization problem to set the step-size and also require the Frank-Wolfe
  linear subproblems to be solved exactly. In this paper we propose variants of Away-steps
  and Pairwise FW that lift both restrictions simultaneously. The proposed methods
  set the step-size based on a sufficient decrease condition, and do not require prior
  knowledge of the objective. Furthermore, they inherit all the favorable convergence
  properties of the exact line-search version, including linear convergence for strongly
  convex functions over polytopes. Benchmarks on different machine learning problems
  illustrate large performance gains of the proposed variants.'
