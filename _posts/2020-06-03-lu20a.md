title: Accelerating Gradient Boosting Machines
abstract: 'Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) introduced by \cite{friedman2001greedy}
  is a widely popular ensembling technique and is routinely used in competitions such
  as Kaggle and the KDDCup \citep{chen2016xgboost}. In this work, we propose an Accelerated
  Gradient Boosting Machine (AGBM) by incorporating Nesterov’s acceleration techniques
  into the design of GBM. The difficulty in accelerating GBM lies in the fact that
  weak (inexact) learners are commonly used, and therefore, with naive application,
  the errors can accumulate in the momentum term. To overcome it, we design a “corrected
  pseudo residual” that serves as a new target for fitting a weak learner, in order
  to perform the z-update. Thus, we are able to derive novel computational guarantees
  for AGBM. This is the first GBM type of algorithm with a theoretically-justified
  accelerated convergence rate. '
