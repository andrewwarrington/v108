title: " Safe-Bayesian Generalized Linear Regression"
abstract: We study generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification,  i.e. when
  the model is ‘wrong but useful’. Generalized Bayes equips  the likelihood with a
  learning rate $\eta$. We show that for  generalized linear models (GLMs), $\eta$-generalized
  Bayes  concentrates around the best approximation of the truth within the  model
  for specific $\eta eq 1$, even under severely misspecified  noise, as long as the
  tails of the true distribution are exponential. We  derive MCMC samplers for generalized
  Bayesian lasso and  logistic regression and give examples of both  simulated and
  real-world data in which generalized Bayes  substantially outperforms standard Bayes.
