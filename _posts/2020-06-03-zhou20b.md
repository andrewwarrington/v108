title: Accelerated Factored Gradient Descent for Low-Rank Matrix Factorization
abstract: 'We study the low-rank matrix estimation problem, where the objective function
  $\mathcal{L}(\Mb)$ is defined over the space of positive semidefinite matrices with
  rank less than or equal to $r$. A fast approach to solve this problem is matrix
  factorization, which reparameterizes $\mathbf{M}$ as the product of two smaller
  matrix such that $\mathbf{M} =\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^\top$ and then performs gradient
  descent on $\mathbf{U}$ directly, a.k.a., factored gradient descent. Since the resulting
  problem is nonconvex, whether Nesterov’s acceleration scheme can be adapted to it
  remains a long-standing question. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively
  by proposing a novel and practical accelerated factored gradient descent method
  motivated by Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent. The proposed method enjoys
  better iteration complexity and computational complexity than the state-of-the-art
  algorithms in a wide regime. The key idea of our algorithm is to restrict all its
  iterates onto a special convex set, which enables the acceleration. Experimental
  results demonstrate the faster convergence of our algorithm and corroborate our
  theory. '
