title: Lipschitz Continuous Autoencoders in Application to Anomaly Detection
abstract: Anomaly detection is the task of finding abnormal data that are distinct
  from normal behavior. Current deep learning-based anomaly detection methods train
  neural networks with normal data alone and calculate anomaly scores based on the
  trained model. In this work, we formalize current practices, build a theoretical
  framework of anomaly detection algorithms equipped with an objective function and
  a hypothesis space, and establish a desirable property of the anomaly detection
  algorithm, namely, admissibility. Admissibility implies that optimal autoencoders
  for normal data yield a larger reconstruction error for anomalous data than that
  for normal data on average. We then propose a class of admissible anomaly detection
  algorithms equipped with an integral probability metric-based objective function
  and a class of autoencoders, Lipschitz continuous autoencoders. The proposed algorithm
  for Wasserstein distance is implemented by minimizing an approximated Wasserstein
  distance with a penalty to enforce Lipschitz continuity with respect to Wasserstein
  distance. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of enforcing Lipschitz
  continuity of the proposed method. The proposed method is shown to be more effective
  in detecting anomalies than existing methods via applications to network traffic
  and image datasets.
