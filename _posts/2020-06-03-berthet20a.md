title: Statistical and Computational Rates in Graph Logistic Regression
abstract: We consider the problem of graph logistic regression, based on partial observation
  of a large network, and on side information associated to its vertices. The generative
  model is formulated as a matrix logistic regression. The performance of the model
  is analyzed in a high-dimensional regime under a structural assumption. The optimal
  statistical rates are derived, and an estimator based on penalized maximum likelihood
  is shown to attain it. The algorithmic aspects of this problem are also studied,
  and optimal rates under computational constraints are derived, and shown to differ
  from the information-theoretic rates - under a complexity assumption.
