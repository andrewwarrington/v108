title: On the Sample Complexity of Learning Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) can be regarded as a form of deep graphical
  models that compactly represent deeply factored and mixed distributions. An SPN
  is a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of a set of leaves (corresponding
  to base distributions), a set of sum nodes (which represent mixtures of their children
  distributions) and a set of product nodes (representing the products of its children
  distributions). In this work, we initiate the study of the sample complexity of
  PAC-learning the set of distributions that correspond to SPNs. We show that the
  sample complexity of learning tree structured SPNs with the usual type of leaves
  (i.e., Gaussian or discrete) grows at most linearly (up to logarithmic factors)
  with the number of parameters of the SPN.More specifically, we show that the class
  of distributions that corresponds to tree structured Gaussian SPNs with $k$ mixing
  weights and $e$ ($d$-dimensional Gaussian) leaves can be learned within Total Variation
  error $\epsilon$ using at most $\widetilde{O}(\frac{ed^2+k}{\epsilon^2})$ samples.
  A similar result holds for tree structured SPNs with discrete leaves. We obtain
  the upper bounds based on the recently proposed notion of distribution compression
  schemes. More specifically, we show that if a (base) class of distributions $\cF$
  admits an “efficient” compression, then the class of tree structured SPNs with leaves
  from $\cF$ also admits an efficient compression.
