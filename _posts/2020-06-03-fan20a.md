title: Online Binary Space Partitioning Forests
abstract: The Binary Space Partitioning-TreeÂ (BSP-Tree) process was recently proposed
  as an efficient strategy for space partitioning tasks. Because it uses more than
  one dimension to partition the space, the BSP-Tree process is more efficient and
  flexible than conventional axis-aligned cut strategies. However, due to its batch
  learning setting, it is not well suited to large-scale classification and regression
  problems. In this paper, we develop an online BSP-Forest framework to address this
  limitation. With the arrival of new data, the resulting online algorithm can simultaneously
  expand the space coverage and refine the partition structure, with guaranteed universal
  consistency for classification problems. The effectiveness and competitive performance
  of the online BSP-Forest is verified via simulations.
