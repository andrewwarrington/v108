title: Equalized odds postprocessing under imperfect group information
abstract: Most approaches aiming to ensure a model’s fairness with respect to a protected
  attribute (such as gender or race) assume to know the true value of the attribute
  for every data point. In this paper, we ask to what extent fairness interventions
  can be effective even when only imperfect information about the protected attribute
  is available. In particular, we study the prominent equalized odds postprocessing
  method of Hardt et al. (2016) under a perturbation of the attribute. We identify
  conditions on the perturbation that guarantee that the bias of a classifier is reduced
  even by running equalized odds with the perturbed attribute. We also study the error
  of the resulting classifier. We empirically observe that under our identified conditions
  most often the error does not suffer from a perturbation of the protected attribute.
  For a special case, we formally prove this observation to be true.
