title: Uncertainty Quantification for Sparse Deep Learning
abstract: Deep learning methods continue to have a decided impact on machine learning,
  both in theory and in practice. Statistical theoretical developments have been mostly
  concerned with approximability or rates of estimation when recovering infinite dimensional
  objects (curves or densities). Despite the impressive array of available theoretical
  results, the literature has been largely silent about uncertainty quantification
  for deep learning. This paper takes a step forward in this important direction by
  taking a Bayesian point of view. We study Gaussian approximability of certain aspects
  of posterior distributions of sparse deep ReLU architectures in non-parametric regression.
  Building on tools from Bayesian non-parametrics, we provide semi-parametric Bernstein-von
  Mises theorems for linear and quadratic functionals, which guarantee that implied
  Bayesian credible regions have valid frequentist coverage. Our results provide new
  theoretical justifications for (Bayesian) deep learning with ReLU activation functions,
  highlighting their inferential potential.
