title: 'Rep the Set: Neural Networks for Learning Set Representations'
abstract: In several domains, data objects can be decomposed into sets of simpler
  objects. It is then natural to represent each object as the set of its components
  or parts. Many conventional machine learning algorithms are unable to process this
  kind of representations, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a
  meaningful ordering. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture,
  called RepSet, that can handle examples that are represented as sets of vectors.
  The proposed model computes the correspondences between an input set and some hidden
  sets by solving a series of network flow problems. This representation is then fed
  to a standard neural network architecture to produce the output. The architecture
  allows end-to-end gradient-based learning. We demonstrate RepSet on classification
  tasks, including text categorization, and graph classification, and we show that
  the proposed neural network achieves performance better or comparable to state-of-the-art
  algorithms.
