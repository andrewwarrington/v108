title: 'Old Dog Learns New Tricks: Randomized UCB for Bandit Problems'
abstract: 'We propose RandUCB, a bandit strategy that uses theoretically derived confidence
  intervals similar to upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms, but akin to Thompson
  sampling (TS), uses randomization to trade off exploration and exploitation. In
  the $K$-armed bandit setting, we show that there are infinitely many variants of
  RandUCB, all of which achieve the minimax-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{K T})$ regret
  after $T$ rounds. Moreover, in a specific multi-armed bandit setting, we show that
  both  UCB and TS can be recovered as special cases of RandUCB. For structured bandits,
  where each arm is associated with a $d$-dimensional feature vector and rewards are
  distributed according to a linear or generalized linear model, we prove that RandUCB
  achieves the minimax-optimal $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{T})$ regret even in the case
  of infinite arms. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of RandUCB with experiments
  in both multi-armed and structured bandit settings. We show that RandUCB matches
  the empirical performance of TS while matching the theoretically optimal bounds
  of UCB algorithms, thus achieving the best of both worlds. '
