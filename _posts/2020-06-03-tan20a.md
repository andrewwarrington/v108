title: Learning Fair Representations for Kernel Models
abstract: Fair representations are a powerful tool for establishing criteria like
  statistical parity, proxy non-discrimination, and equality of opportunity in learned
  models. Existing techniques for learning these representations are typically model-agnostic,
  as they preprocess the original data such that the output satisfies some fairness
  criterion, and can be used with arbitrary learning methods. In contrast, we demonstrate
  the promise of learning a model-aware fair representation, focusing on kernel-based
  models. We leverage the classical Sufficient Dimension Reduction (SDR) framework
  to construct representations as subspaces of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space
  (RKHS), whose member functions are guaranteed to satisfy fairness. Our method supports
  several fairness criteria,  continuous and discrete data, and multiple protected
  attributes.  We further show how to calibrate the accuracy tradeoff by characterizing
  it in terms of the principal angles between subspaces of the RKHS. Finally, we apply
  our approach to obtain the first Fair Gaussian Process (FGP) prior for fair Bayesian
  learning, and show that it is competitive with, and in some cases outperforms, state-of-the-art
  methods on real data.
