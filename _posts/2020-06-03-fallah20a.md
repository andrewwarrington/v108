title: On the Convergence Theory of Gradient-Based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithms
abstract: We study the convergence of a class of gradient-based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
  (MAML) methods and characterize their overall complexity as well as their best achievable
  accuracy in terms of gradient norm for nonconvex loss functions. We start with the
  MAML method and its first-order approximation (FO-MAML) and highlight the challenges
  that emerge in their analysis. By overcoming these challenges not only we provide
  the first theoretical guarantees for MAML and FO-MAML in nonconvex settings, but
  also we answer some of the unanswered questions for the implementation of these
  algorithms including how to choose their learning rate and the batch size for both
  tasks and  datasets corresponding to tasks. In particular, we show that MAML can
  find an ?-first-order stationary point ( ?-FOSP) for any positive  ? after at most
  O(1/?^2) iterations at the expense of requiring second-order information. We also
  show that FO-MAML which ignores the second-order information required in the update
  of MAML cannot achieve any small desired level of accuracy, i.e., FO-MAML cannot
  find an  ?-FOSP for any  ?>0. We  further propose a new variant of the MAML algorithm
  called Hessian-free MAML which preserves all theoretical guarantees of MAML, without
  requiring access to second-order information.
