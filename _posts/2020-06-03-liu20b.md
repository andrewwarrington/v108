title: High Dimensional Robust Sparse Regression
abstract: 'We provide a novel – and to the best of our knowledge, the first – algorithm
  for high dimensional sparse regression with constant fraction of corruptions in
  explanatory and/or response variables. Our algorithm recovers the true sparse parameters
  with sub-linear sample complexity,in the presence of a constant fraction of arbitrary
  corruptions. Our main contribution is a robust variant of Iterative Hard Thresholding.
  Using this, we provide accurate estimators:when the covariance matrix in sparse
  regression is identity,  our error guarantee is near information-theoretically optimal.
  We then deal with robust sparse regression with unknown structured covariance matrix.
  We propose a filtering algorithm whichconsists of a novel randomized outlier removal
  technique for robust sparse mean estimation that may be of interest in its own right:
  the filtering algorithm is flexible enough to deal with unknown covariance.Also,
  it is orderwise more efficient computationally than the ellipsoid algorithm.Using
  sub-linear sample complexity, our algorithm achieves the best known (and first)
  error guarantee. We demonstrate the effectiveness on large-scale sparse regression
  problems with arbitrary corruptions.'
