title: A Tight and Unified Analysis of Gradient-Based Methods for a Whole Spectrum
  of Differentiable Games
abstract: 'We consider differentiable games where the goal is to find a Nash equilibrium.
  The machine learning community has recently started using variants of the gradient
  method (GD). Prime examples are extragradient (EG), the optimistic gradient method
  (OG) and consensus optimization (CO) which enjoy linear convergence in cases like
  bilinear games, where the standard GD fails. The full benefits of theses relatively
  new methods are not known as there is no unified analysis for both strongly monotone
  and bilinear games. We provide new analysis of the EG’s local and global convergence
  properties and use is to get a tighter global convergence rate for OG and CO. Our
  analysis covers the whole range of settings between bilinear and strongly monotone
  games. It reveals that these methods converges via different mechanisms at these
  extremes; in between, it exploits the most favorable mechanism for the given problem.
  We then prove that EG achieves the optimal rate for a wide class of algorithms with
  any number of extrapolations. Our tight analysis of EG’s convergence rate in games
  shows that, unlike in convex minimization, EG may be much faster than GD. '
