title: Optimized Score Transformation for Fair Classification
abstract: This paper considers fair probabilistic classification where the outputs
  of primary interest are predicted probabilities, commonly referred to as scores.
  We formulate the problem of transforming scores to satisfy fairness constraints
  while minimizing the loss in utility. The formulation can be applied either to post-process
  classifier outputs or to pre-process training data, thus allowing maximum freedom
  in selecting a classification algorithm. We derive a closed-form expression for
  the optimal transformed scores and a convex optimization problem for the transformation
  parameters. In the population limit, the transformed score function is the fairness-constrained
  minimizer of cross-entropy with respect to the optimal unconstrained scores. In
  the finite sample setting, we propose to approach this solution using a combination
  of standard probabilistic classifiers and ADMM. Comprehensive experiments comparing
  to 10 existing methods show that the proposed FairScoreTransformer has advantages
  for score-based metrics such as Brier score and AUC while remaining competitive
  for binary label-based metrics such as accuracy.
