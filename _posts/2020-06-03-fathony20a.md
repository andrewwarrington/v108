title: 'AP-Perf: Incorporating Generic Performance Metrics in Differentiable Learning'
abstract: We propose a method that enables practitioners to conveniently incorporate
  custom non-decomposable performance metrics into differentiable learning pipelines,
  notably those based upon neural network architectures. Our approach is based on
  the recently developed adversarial prediction framework, a distributionally robust
  approach that optimizes a metric in the worst case given the statistical summary
  of the empirical distribution. We formulate a marginal distribution technique to
  reduce the complexity of optimizing the adversarial prediction formulation over
  a vast range of non-decomposable metrics. We demonstrate how easy it is to write
  and incorporate complex custom metrics using our provided tool. Finally, we show
  the effectiveness of our approach various classification tasks on tabular datasets
  from the UCI repository and benchmark datasets, as well as image classification
  tasks. The code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/rizalzaf/AdversarialPrediction.jl.
