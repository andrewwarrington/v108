title: Prediction Focused Topic Models via Feature Selection
abstract: Supervised topic models are often sought to balance prediction quality and
  interpretability.  However, when models are (inevitably) misspecified, standard
  approaches rarely deliver on both.  We introduce a novel approach, the prediction-focused
  topic model, that uses the supervisory signal to retain only vocabulary terms that
  improve, or at least do not hinder, prediction performance.  By removing terms with
  irrelevant signal, the topic model is able to learn task-relevant, coherent topics.  We
  demonstrate on several data sets that compared to existing approaches, prediction-focused
  topic models learn much more coherent topics while maintaining competitive predictions.
