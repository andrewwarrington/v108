title: The Expressive Power of a Class of Normalizing Flow Models
abstract: 'Normalizing flows have received a great deal of recent attention as they
  allow flexible generative modeling as well as easy likelihood computation. While
  a wide variety of flow models have been proposed, there is little formal understanding
  of the representation power of these models. In this work, we study some basic normalizing
  flows and rigorously establish bounds on their expressive power. Our results indicate
  that while these flows are highly expressive in one dimension, in higher dimensions
  their representation power may be limited, especially when the flows have moderate
  depth. '
