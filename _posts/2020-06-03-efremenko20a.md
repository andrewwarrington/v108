title: Fast and Bayes-consistent nearest neighbors
abstract: 'Research on nearest-neighbor methods tends to focus somewhat dichotomously
  either on the statistical or the computational aspects – either on, say, Bayes consistency
  and rates of convergence or on techniques for speeding up the proximity search.
  This paper aims at bridging these realms: to reap the advantages of fast evaluation
  time while maintaining Bayes consistency, and further without sacrificing too much
  in the risk decay rate. We combine the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique
  with a novel missing-mass argument to obtain a fast and Bayes-consistent classifier.
  Our algorithm’s prediction runtime compares favorably against state of the art approximate
  NN methods, while maintaining Bayes-consistency and attaining rates comparable to
  minimax. On samples of size $n$ in $\R^d$, our pre-processing phase has runtime
  $O(d n \log n)$, while the evaluation phase has runtime $O(d\log n)$ per query point.'
