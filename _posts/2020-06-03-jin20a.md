title: Graph Coarsening with Preserved Spectral Properties
abstract: 'In graph coarsening, one aims to produce a coarse graph of reduced size
  while preserving important graph properties. However, as there is no consensus on
  which specific graph properties should be preserved by coarse graphs, measuring
  the differences between original and coarse graphs remains a key challenge. This
  work relies on spectral graph theory to justify a distance function constructed
  to measure the similarity between original and coarse graphs. We show that the proposed
  spectral distance captures the structural differences in the graph coarsening process.
  We also propose graph coarsening algorithms that aim to minimize the spectral distance.
  Experiments show that the proposed algorithms can outperform previous graph coarsening
  methods in graph classification and stochastic block recovery tasks. '
