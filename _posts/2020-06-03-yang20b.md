title: 'Robustness for Non-Parametric Classification: A Generic Attack and Defense'
abstract: Adversarially robust machine learning has received much recent attention.
  However, prior attacks and defenses for non-parametric classifiers have been developed
  in an ad-hoc or classifier-specific basis. In this work, we take a holistic look
  at adversarial examples for non-parametric classifiers, including nearest neighbors,
  decision trees, and random forests. We provide a general defense method, adversarial
  pruning, that works by preprocessing the dataset to become well-separated. To test
  our defense, we provide a novel attack that applies to a wide  range of non-parametric
  classifiers. Theoretically, we derive an optimally robust classifier, which is analogous
  to the Bayes Optimal. We show that adversarial pruning can be viewed as a finite
  sample approximation to this optimal classifier. We empirically show that our defense
  and attack are either better than or competitive with prior work on non-parametric
  classifiers. Overall, our results provide a strong and broadly-applicable baseline
  for future work on robust non-parametrics.
