title: Learning piecewise Lipschitz functions in changing environments
abstract: Optimization in the presence of sharp (non-Lipschitz), unpredictable (w.r.t.
  time and amount) changes is a challenging and largely unexplored problem of great
  significance. We consider the class of piecewise Lipschitz functions, which is the
  most general online setting considered in the literature for the problem, and arises
  naturally in various combinatorial algorithm selection problems where utility functions
  can have sharp discontinuities. The usual performance metric of ‘static’ regret
  minimizes the gap between the payoff accumulated and that of the best fixed point
  for the entire duration, and thus fails to capture changing environments. Shifting
  regret is a useful alternative, which allows for up to $s$ environment {\it shifts}.
  In this work we provide an $O(\sqrt{sdT\log T}+sT^{1-\beta})$ regret bound for $\beta$-dispersed
  functions, where $\beta$ roughly quantifies the rate at which discontinuities appear
  in the utility functions in expectation (typically $\beta\ge1/2$ in problems of
  practical interest \cite{2019arXiv190409014B,balcan2018dispersion}). We also present
  a lower bound tight up to sub-logarithmic factors. We further obtain improved bounds
  when selecting from a small pool of experts. We empirically demonstrate a key application
  of our algorithms to online clustering problems on popular benchmarks.
