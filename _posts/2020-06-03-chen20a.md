title: Efficient Spectrum-Revealing CUR Matrix Decomposition
abstract: The CUR matrix decomposition is an important tool for low-rank matrix approximation.
  It approximates a data matrix though selecting a small number of columns and rows
  of the matrix. Those CUR algorithms with  gap-dependent approximation bounds can
  obtain high approximation quality for matrices with good singular value spectrum
  decay, but they have impractically high time complexities. In this paper, we propose
  a novel CUR algorithm based on truncated LU factorization with an efficient variant
  of complete pivoting. Our algorithm has gap-dependent approximation bounds on both
  spectral and Frobenius norms while maintaining high efficiency. Numerical experiments
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and verify our theoretical guarantees.
