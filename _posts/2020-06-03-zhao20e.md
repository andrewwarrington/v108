title: A Framework for Sample Efficient Interval Estimation with Control Variates
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating confidence intervals for the mean
  of a random variable, where the goal is to produce the smallest possible interval
  for a given number of samples. While minimax optimal algorithms are known for this
  problem in the general case, improved performance is possible under additional assumptions.
  In particular, we design an estimation algorithm to take advantage of side information
  in the form of a control variate, leveraging order statistics. Under certain conditions
  on the quality of the control variates, we show improved asymptotic efficiency compared
  to existing estimation algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance
  on several real world surveying and estimation tasks where we use regression models
  as control variates.
