title: Finite-Time Analysis of Decentralized Temporal-Difference Learning with Linear
  Function Approximation
abstract: 'Motivated by the emerging use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
  in engineering applications such as networked robotics, swarming drones, and sensor
  networks, we investigate the policy evaluation problem in a fully decentralized
  setting, using temporal-difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation
  to handle large state spaces in practice. The goal of the group of agents is to
  collaboratively learn the value function of a given policy from locally private
  rewards observed in a shared environment, through exchanging local estimates with
  neighbors. Despite their simplicity and widespread use, our theoretical understanding
  of such decentralized TD learning algorithms remains limited. Existing results were
  obtained based on i.i.d. data samples, or by imposing an ‘additional’ projection
  step to control the ‘gradient’ bias incurred by the Markovian observations. In this
  paper, we provide a finite-time analysis of the fully decentralized TD(0) learning
  under both i.i.d. as well as Markovian samples, and prove that all local estimates
  converge linearly to a small neighborhood of the optimum. The resultant error bounds
  are the first of its type—in the sense that they hold under the most practical assumptions—which
  is made possible by means of a novel multi-step Lyapunov approach.  '
