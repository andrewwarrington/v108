title: An Empirical Study of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Structured Covariance
  Noise
abstract: The choice of batch-size in a stochastic optimization algorithm plays a
  substantial role for both optimization and generalization. Increasing the batch-size
  used typically improves optimization but degrades generalization. To address the
  problem of improving generalization while maintaining optimal convergence in large-batch
  training, we propose to add covariance noise to the gradients. We demonstrate that
  the learning performance of our method is more accurately captured by the structure
  of the covariance matrix of the noise rather than by the variance of gradients.
  Moreover, over the convex-quadratic, we prove in theory that it can be characterized
  by the Frobenius norm of the noise matrix. Our empirical studies with standard deep
  learning model-architectures and datasets shows that our method not only improves
  generalization performance in large-batch training, but furthermore, does so in
  a way where the optimization performance remains desirable and the training duration
  is not elongated.
