title: Convergence Analysis of Block Coordinate Algorithms with Determinantal Sampling
abstract: We analyze the convergence rate of the randomized Newton-like method        introduced
  by Qu et. al. (2016) for smooth and convex        objectives, which uses random
  coordinate        blocks of a Hessian-over-approximation matrix        M instead
  of the true Hessian. The convergence analysis of the algorithm is          challenging
  because of its complex dependence on the structure        of M. However, we show
  that when the coordinate blocks are        sampled with probability         proportional
  to their determinant, the convergence rate depends solely on the eigenvalue distribution
  of matrix M, and has an analytically tractable form. To         do so, we derive
  a fundamental new expectation formula for        determinantal point processes.
  We show that determinantal        sampling allows us to reason about the optimal
  subset size of        blocks in terms of the spectrum of M. Additionally, we        provide
  a        numerical evaluation of our analysis,        demonstrating cases where
  determinantal sampling is superior        or on par with uniform sampling.
