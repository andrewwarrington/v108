title: Randomized Exploration in Generalized Linear Bandits
abstract: We study two randomized algorithms for generalized linear bandits. The first,
  GLM-TSL, samples a generalized linear model (GLM) from the Laplace approximation
  to the posterior distribution. The second, GLM-FPL, fits a GLM to a randomly perturbed
  history of past rewards. We analyze both algorithms and derive $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{n
  \log K})$ upper bounds on their $n$-round regret, where $d$ is the number of features
  and $K$ is the number of arms. The former improves on prior work while the latter
  is the first for Gaussian noise perturbations in non-linear models. We empirically
  evaluate both GLM-TSL and GLM-FPL in logistic bandits, and apply GLM-FPL to neural
  network bandits. Our work showcases the role of randomization, beyond posterior
  sampling, in exploration.
