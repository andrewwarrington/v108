title: A Nonparametric Off-Policy Policy Gradient
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms still suffer from high sample complexity
  despite outstanding recent successes. The need for intensive interactions with the
  environment is especially observed in many widely popular policy gradient algorithms
  that perform updates using on-policy samples. The priceof such inefficiency becomes
  evident in real world scenarios such as interaction-driven robot learning, where
  the success of RL has been rather limited. We address this issue by building on
  the general sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. With nonparametric regression
  and density estimation methods we construct a nonparametric Bellman equation in
  a principled manner, which allows us to obtain closed-form estimates of the value
  function, and to analytically express the full policy gradient. We provide a theoretical
  analysis of our estimate to show that it is consistent under mild smoothness assumptions
  and empirically show that our approach has better sample efficiency than state-of-the-art
  policy gradient methods.
