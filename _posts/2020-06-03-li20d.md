title: A Fast Anderson-Chebyshev Acceleration for Nonlinear Optimization
abstract: "\\emph{Anderson acceleration} (or Anderson mixing) is an efficient acceleration
  method for fixed point iterations $x_{t+1}=G(x_t)$, e.g., gradient descent can be
  viewed as iteratively applying the operation $G(x) \\triangleq x-\\alphaabla f(x)$.
  \ It is known that Anderson acceleration is quite efficient in practice and can
  be viewed as an extension of Krylov subspace methods for nonlinear problems.  In
  this paper, we show that Anderson acceleration with Chebyshev polynomial can achieve
  the optimal convergence rate $O(\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, which
  improves the previous result $O(\\kappa\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ provided by (Toth
  & Kelley, 2015) for quadratic functions.  Moreover, we provide a convergence analysis
  for minimizing general nonlinear problems.  Besides, if the hyperparameters (e.g.,
  the Lipschitz smooth parameter $L$) are not available, we propose a \\emph{guessing
  algorithm} for guessing them dynamically and also prove a similar convergence rate.
  \ Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Anderson-Chebyshev
  acceleration method converges significantly faster than other algorithms, e.g.,
  vanilla gradient descent (GD), Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated GD.  Also, these algorithms
  combined with the proposed guessing algorithm (guessing the hyperparameters dynamically)
  achieve much better performance."
