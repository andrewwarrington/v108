title: 'Ordered SGD: A New Stochastic Optimization Framework for Empirical Risk Minimization'
abstract: We propose a new stochastic optimization framework for empirical risk minimization
  problems such as those that arise in machine learning. The traditional approaches,
  such as (mini-batch) stochastic gradient descent (SGD), utilize an unbiased gradient
  estimator of the empirical average loss. In contrast, we develop a computationally
  efficient method to construct a gradient estimator that is purposely biased toward
  those observations with higher current losses. On the theory side, we show that
  the proposed method minimizes a new ordered modification of the empirical average
  loss, and is guaranteed to converge at a sublinear rate to a global optimum for
  convex loss and to a critical point for weakly convex (non-convex) loss. Furthermore,
  we prove a new generalization bound for the proposed algorithm. On the empirical
  side, the numerical experiments show that our proposed method consistently improves
  the test errors compared with the standard mini-batch SGD in various models including
  SVM, logistic regression, and deep learning problems.
