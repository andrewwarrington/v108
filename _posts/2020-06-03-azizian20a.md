title: Accelerating Smooth Games by Manipulating Spectral Shapes
abstract: 'We use matrix iteration theory to characterize acceleration in smooth games.
  We define the spectral shape of a family of games as the set containing all eigenvalues
  of the Jacobians of standard gradient dynamics in the family. Shapes restricted
  to the real line represent well-understood classes of problems, like minimization.
  Shapes spanning the complex plane capture the added numerical challenges in solving
  smooth games. In this framework, we describe gradient-based methods, such as extragradient,
  as transformations on the spectral shape. Using this perspective, we propose an
  optimal algorithm for bilinear games. For smooth and strongly monotone operators,
  we identify a continuum between convex minimization, where acceleration is possible
  using Polyak’s momentum, and the worst case where gradient descent is optimal. Finally,
  going beyond first-order methods, we propose an accelerated version of consensus
  optimization. '
