title: A Stein Goodness-of-fit Test for Directional Distributions
abstract: In many fields, data appears in the form of direction (unit vector) and
  usual statistical procedures are not applicable to such directional data. In this
  study, we propose nonparametric goodness-of-fit testing procedures for general directional
  distributions based on kernel Stein discrepancy. Our method is based on Stein’s
  operator on spheres, which is derived by using Stokes’ theorem. Notably, the proposed
  method is applicable to distributions with an intractable normalization constant,
  which commonly appear in directional statistics. Experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed methods control type-I error well and have larger power than existing
  tests, including the test based on the maximum mean discrepancy.
