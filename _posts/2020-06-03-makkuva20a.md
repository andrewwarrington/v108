title: Learning in Gated Neural Networks
abstract: 'Gating is a key feature in modern neural networks including LSTMs, GRUs
  and sparsely-gated deep neural networks. The backbone of such gated networks is
  a mixture-of-experts layer, where several experts make regression decisions and
  gating controls how to weigh the decisions in an input-dependent manner. Despite
  having such a prominent role in both modern and classical machine learning, very
  little is understood about parameter recovery of mixture-of-experts since gradient
  descent and EM algorithms are known to be stuck in local optima in such models.In
  this paper, we perform a careful analysis of the optimization landscape and show
  that with appropriately designed loss functions, gradient descent can indeed learn
  the parameters accurately. A key idea underpinning our results is the design of
  two {\em distinct} loss functions, one for recovering the expert parameters and
  another for recovering the gating parameters. We demonstrate the first sample complexity
  results for parameter recovery in this model for any algorithm and demonstrate significant
  performance gains over standard loss functions in numerical experiments. '
