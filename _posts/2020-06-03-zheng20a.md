title: Learning Sparse Nonparametric DAGs
abstract: We develop a framework for learning sparse nonparametric directed acyclic
  graphs (DAGs) from data. Our approach is based on a recent algebraic characterization
  of DAGs that led to the first fully continuous optimization for score-based learning
  of DAG models parametrized by a linear structural equation model (SEM). We extend
  this algebraic characterization to nonparametric SEM by leveraging nonparametric
  sparsity based on partial derivatives, resulting in a continuous optimization problem
  that can be applied to a variety of nonparametric and semiparametric models including
  GLMs, additive noise models, and index models as special cases. Unlike existing
  approaches that require specific modeling choices, loss functions, or algorithms,
  we present a completely general framework that can be applied to general nonlinear
  models (e.g. without additive noise), general differentiable loss functions, and
  generic black-box optimization routines.
