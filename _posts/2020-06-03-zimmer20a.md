title: Adaptive Discretization for Evaluation of Probabilistic Cost Functions
abstract: In many real-world planning applications, e.g. dynamic design of experiments,
  autonomous driving and robot manipulation, it is necessary to evaluate candidate
  movement paths with respect to a safety cost function. Here, the continuous candidate
  paths need to be discretized first and, subsequently, evaluated onthe discretization
  points. The resulting quality of planned paths, thus, highly depends on the definition
  of the safety cost functions, and the resolution of the discretization. In this
  paper, we propose an approach for evaluating continuous candidate paths by employing
  an adaptive discretization scheme, with a probabilistic cost function learned from
  observations. The obtained path is then guaranteed to be epsilon-safe, i.e. the
  remaining risk of still finding an unsafe point on the trajectory is smaller than
  epsilon. The proposed approach is investigated theoretically, as well as empirically
  validated on several robotic path planning scenarios.
