title: On the Completeness of Causal Discovery in the Presence of Latent Confounding
  with Tiered Background Knowledge
abstract: The discovery of causal relationships is a core part of scientific research.
  Accordingly, over the past several decades, algorithms have been developed to discover
  the causal structure for a system of variables from observational data. Learning
  ancestral graphs is of particular interest due to their ability to represent latent
  confounding implicitly with bi-directed edges. The well-known FCI algorithm provably
  recovers an ancestral graph for a system of variables encoding the sound and complete
  set of causal relationships identifiable from observational data. Additional causal
  relationships become identifiable with the incorporation of background knowledge;
  however, it is not known for what types of knowledge FCI remains complete. In this
  paper, we define tiered background knowledge and show that FCI is sound and complete
  with the incorporation of this knowledge.
