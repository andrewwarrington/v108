title: Marginal Densities, Factor Graph Duality, and High-Temperature Series Expansions
abstract: 'We prove that the marginal densities of a global probability mass function
  in aprimal normal factor graph and the corresponding marginal densities in the dual
  normal factor graph are related via local mappings. The mapping depends on the Fourier
  transform of the local factors of the models. Details of the mapping, including
  its fixed points, are derived for the Ising model, and then extended to the Potts
  model. By employing the mapping, we can transform simultaneously all the estimated
  marginal densities from one domain to the other, which is advantageous if estimating
  the marginals can be carried out more efficiently in the dual domain.An example
  of particular significance is the ferromagnetic Ising model in a positive external
  field, for which there is a rapidly mixing Markov chain (called the subgraphs-world
  process) to generate configurations in the dual normal factor graph of the model.
  Our numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed procedure can provide more
  accurate estimates of marginal densities in various settings. '
