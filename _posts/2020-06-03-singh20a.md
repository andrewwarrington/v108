title: 'Context Mover’s Distance & Barycenters: Optimal Transport of Contexts for
  Building Representations'
abstract: 'We present a framework for building unsupervised representations of entities
  and their compositions, where each entity is viewed as a probability distribution
  rather than a vector embedding. In particular, this distribution is supported over
  the contexts which co-occur with the entity and are embedded in a suitable low-dimensional
  space. This enables us to consider representation learning from the perspective
  of Optimal Transport and take advantage of its tools such as Wasserstein distance
  and barycenters. We elaborate how the method can be applied for obtaining unsupervised
  representations of text and illustrate the performance (quantitatively as well as
  qualitatively) on tasks such as measuring sentence similarity, word entailment and
  similarity, where we empirically observe significant gains (e.g., 4.1% relative
  improvement over Sent2vec, GenSen).The key benefits of the proposed approach include:
  (a) capturing uncertainty and polysemy via modeling the entities as distributions,
  (b) utilizing the underlying geometry of the particular task (with the ground cost),
  (c) simultaneously providing interpretability with the notion of optimal transport
  between contexts and (d) easy applicability on top of existing point embedding methods.
  The code, as well as pre-built histograms, are available under https://github.com/context-mover/.'
