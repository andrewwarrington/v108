title: Learning spectrograms with convolutional spectral kernels
abstract: We introduce the convolutional spectral kernel (CSK), a novel family of
  non-stationary, nonparametric covariance kernels for Gaussian process (GP) models,
  derived from the convolution between two imaginary radial basis functions. We present
  a principled framework to interpret CSK, as well as other deep probabilistic models,
  using approximated Fourier transform, yielding a concise representation of input-frequency
  spectrogram. Observing through the lens of the spectrogram, we provide insight on
  the interpretability of deep models. We then infer the functional hyperparameters
  using scalable variational and MCMC methods. On small- and medium-sized spatiotemporal
  datasets, we demonstrate improved generalization of GP models when equipped with
  CSK, and their capability to extract non-stationary periodic patterns.
