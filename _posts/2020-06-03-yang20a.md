title: Adaptive Online Kernel Sampling for Vertex Classification
abstract: This paper studies online kernel learning (OKL) for graph classification
  problem, since the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert
  spaces often contains an accurate function. Nonetheless, optimizing over this space
  is computationally expensive. To address this issue, approximate OKL is introduced
  to reduce the complexity either by limiting the support vector (SV) used by the
  predictor, or by avoiding the kernelization process altogether using embedding.
  Nonetheless, as long as the size of the approximation space or the number of SV
  does not grow over time, an adversarial environment can always exploit the approximation
  process. In this paper, we introduce an online kernel sampling (OKS) technique,
  a new second-order OKL method that slightly improve the bound from $O(d \log(T))$
  down to $O(r \log(T))$ where $r$ is the rank of the learned data and is usually
  much smaller than d. To reduce the computational complexity of second-order methods,
  we introduce a randomized sampling algorithm for sketching kernel matrix $K_t$ and
  show that our method is effective to reduce the time and space complexity significantly
  while maintaining comparable performance. Empirical experimental results demonstrate
  that the proposed model is highly effective on real-world graph datasets.
