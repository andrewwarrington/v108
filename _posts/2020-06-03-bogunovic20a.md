title: Corruption-Tolerant Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization
abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing an unknown (typically non-convex)
  function with a bounded norm in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), based
  on noisy bandit feedback. We consider a novel variant of this problem in which the
  point evaluations are not only corrupted by random noise, but also adversarial corruptions.
  We introduce an algorithm Fast-Slow GP-UCB based on Gaussian process methods, randomized
  selection between two instances labeled ’fast’ (but non-robust) and ’slow’ (but
  robust), enlarged confidence bounds, and the principle of optimism under uncertainty.
  We present a novel theoret- ical analysis upper bounding the cumulative regret in
  terms of the corruption level, the time horizon, and the underlying kernel, and
  we argue that certain dependencies cannot be improved. We observe that distinct
  algorithmic ideas are required depending on whether one is required to perform well
  in both the corrupted and non-corrupted settings, and whether the corruption level
  is known or not.
