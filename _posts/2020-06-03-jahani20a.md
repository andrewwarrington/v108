title: Efficient Distributed Hessian Free Algorithm for Large-scale Empirical Risk
  Minimization via Accumulating Sample Strategy
abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Accumulated Newton Conjugate gradiEnt
  (DANCE) method in which sample size is gradually increasing to quickly obtain a
  solution whose empirical loss is under satisfactory statistical accuracy. Our proposed
  method is multistage in which the solution of a stage serves as a warm start for
  the next stage which contains more samples (including the samples in the previous
  stage). The proposed multistage algorithm reduces the number of passes over data
  to achieve the statistical accuracy of the full training set. Moreover, our algorithm
  in nature is easy to be distributed and shares the strong scaling property indicating
  that acceleration is always expected by using more computing nodes. Various iteration
  complexity results regarding descent direction computation, communication efficiency
  and stopping criteria are analyzed under convex setting. Our numerical results illustrate
  that the proposed method outperforms other comparable methods for solving learning
  problems including neural networks.
