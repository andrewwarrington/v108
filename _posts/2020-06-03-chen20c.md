title: 'Black Box Submodular Maximization: Discrete and Continuous Settings'
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of black box continuous submodular
  maximization where we only have access to the function values and no information
  about the derivatives is provided. For a monotone and continuous DR-submodular function,
  and subject to a bounded convex body constraint, we propose Black-box Continuous
  Greedy, a derivative-free algorithm that provably achieves the tight $[(1-1/e)OPT-\epsilon]$
  approximation guarantee with $O(d/\epsilon^3)$ function evaluations. We then extend
  our result to the stochastic setting where function values are subject to stochastic
  zero-mean noise. It is through this stochastic generalization that we revisit the
  discrete submodular maximization problem and use the multi-linear extension as a
  bridge between discrete and continuous settings. Finally, we extensively evaluate
  the performance of our algorithm on continuous and discrete submodular objective
  functions using both synthetic and real data.
