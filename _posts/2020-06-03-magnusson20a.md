title: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for Bayesian Model Comparison in Large Data
abstract: Recently, new methods for model assessment, based on subsampling and posterior
  approximations, have been proposed for scaling leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV)
  to large datasets. Although these methods work well for estimating predictive performance
  for individual models, they are less powerful in model comparison. We propose an
  efficient method for estimating differences in predictive performance by combining
  fast approximate LOO surrogates with exact LOO sub-sampling using the difference
  estimator and supply proofs with regards to scaling characteristics. The resulting
  approach can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous approaches, as
  well as being better suited to model comparison.
