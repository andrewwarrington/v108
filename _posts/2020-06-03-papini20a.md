title: Balancing Learning Speed and Stability in Policy Gradient via Adaptive Exploration
abstract: " In many Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications, the goal is to find
  an optimal deterministic policy. However, most RL algorithms require the policy
  to be stochastic in order to avoid instabilities and perform a sufficient amount
  of exploration. Adjusting the level of stochasticity during the learning process
  is non-trivial, as it is difficult to assess whether the costs of random exploration
  will be repaid in the long run, and to contain the risk of instability.We study
  this problem in the context of policy gradients (PG) with Gaussian policies. Using
  tools from the safe PG literature, we design a surrogate objective for the policy
  variance that captures the effects this parameter has on the learning speed and
  on the quality of the final solution. Furthermore, we provide a way to optimize
  this objective that guarantees stable improvement of the original performance measure.
  We evaluate the proposed methods on simulated continuous control tasks."
