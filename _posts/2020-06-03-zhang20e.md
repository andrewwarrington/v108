title: 'AMAGOLD: Amortized Metropolis Adjustment for Efficient Stochastic Gradient
  MCMC'
abstract: 'Stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) is an efficient method
  for sampling from continuous distributions. It is a faster alternative to HMC: instead
  of using the whole dataset at each iteration, SGHMC uses only a subsample. This
  improves performance, but introduces bias that can cause SGHMC to converge to the
  wrong distribution. One can prevent this using a step size that decays to zero,
  but such a step size schedule can drastically slow down convergence. To address
  this tension, we propose a novel second-order SG-MCMC algorithm—AMAGOLD—that infrequently
  uses Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) corrections to remove bias. The infrequency of corrections
  amortizes their cost. We prove AMAGOLD converges to the target distribution with
  a fixed, rather than a diminishing, step size, and that its convergence rate is
  at most a constant factor slower than a full-batch baseline. We empirically demonstrate
  AMAGOLD’s effectiveness on synthetic distributions, Bayesian logistic regression,
  and Bayesian neural networks.'
