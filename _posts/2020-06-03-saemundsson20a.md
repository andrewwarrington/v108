title: Variational Integrator Networks for Physically Structured Embeddings
abstract: Learning workable representations of dynamical systems is becoming an increasingly
  important problem in a number of application areas. By leveraging recent work connecting
  deep neural networks to systems of differential equations, we propose \emph{variational
  integrator networks}, a class of neural network architectures designed to preserve
  the geometric structure of physical systems. This class of network architectures
  facilitates accurate long-term prediction, interpretability, and data-efficient
  learning, while still remaining highly flexible and capable of modeling complex
  behavior. We demonstrate that they can accurately learn dynamical systems from both
  noisy observations in phase space and from image pixels within which the unknown
  dynamics are embedded.
