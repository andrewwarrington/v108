title: Causal Bayesian Optimization
abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of globally optimizing a variable of interest
  that is part of a causal model in which a sequence of interventions can be performed.
  This problem arises in biology, operational research, communications and, more generally,
  in all fields where the goal is to optimize an output metric of a system of interconnected
  nodes. Our approach combines ideas from causal inference, uncertainty quantification
  and sequential decision making. In particular, it generalizes Bayesian optimization,
  which treats the input variables of the objective function as independent, to scenarios
  where causal information is available. We show how knowing the causal graph significantly
  improves the ability to reason about optimal decision making strategies decreasing
  the optimization cost while avoiding suboptimal solutions. We propose a new algorithm
  called Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO). CBO automatically balances two trade-offs:
  the classical exploration-exploitation and the new observation-intervention, which
  emerges when combining real interventional data with the estimated intervention
  effects computed via do-calculus. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this
  method in a synthetic setting and in two real-world applications. '
