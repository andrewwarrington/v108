title: Taxonomy of Dual Block-Coordinate Ascent Methods for Discrete Energy Minimization
abstract: We consider the maximum-a-posteriori inference problem in discrete graphical
  models and study solvers based on the dual block-coordinate ascent rule. We map
  all existing solvers in a single framework, allowing for a better understanding
  of their design principles. We theoretically show that some block-optimizing updates
  are sub-optimal and how to strictly improve them. On a wide range of problem instances
  of varying graph connectivity, we study the performance of existingsolvers as well
  as new variants that can be obtained within the framework. As a result of this exploration
  we build a new state-of-the art solver, performing uniformly better on the whole
  range of test instances.
