title: Stretching the Effectiveness of MLE from Accuracy to Bias for Pairwise Comparisons
abstract: A number of applications (e.g., AI bot tournaments, sports, peer grading,
  crowdsourcing) use pairwise comparison data and the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model
  to evaluate a given collection of items (e.g., bots, teams, students, search results).
  Past work has shown that under the BTL model, the widely-used maximum-likelihood
  estimator (MLE) is minimax-optimal in estimating the item parameters, in terms of
  the mean squared error. However, another important desideratum for designing estimators
  is fairness. In this work, we consider one specific type of fairness, which is the
  notion of bias in statistics. We show that the MLE incurs a suboptimal rate in terms
  of bias. We then propose a simple modification to the MLE, which "stretches" the
  bounding box of the maximum-likelihood optimizer by a small constant factor from
  the underlying ground truth domain. We show that this simple modification leads
  to an improved rate in bias, while maintaining minimax-optimality in the mean squared
  error. In this manner, our proposed class of estimators provably improves fairness
  in the sense of bias without loss in accuracy.
