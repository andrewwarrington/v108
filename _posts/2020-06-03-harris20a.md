title: Dependent randomized rounding for clustering and partition systems with knapsack
  constraints
abstract: 'Clustering problems are fundamental to unsupervised learning. There is
  an increased emphasis on \emph{fairness} in machine learning and AI; one representative
  notion of fairness is that no single demographic group should be over-represented
  among the cluster-centers. This, and much more general clustering problems, can
  be formulated with “knapsack" and “partition" constraints. We develop new randomized
  algorithms targeting such problems, and study two in particular: multi-knapsack
  median and multi-knapsack center. Our rounding algorithms give new approximation
  and pseudo-approximation algorithms for these problems. One key technical tool we
  develop and use, which may be of independent interest, is a new tail bound analogous
  to Feige (2006) for sums of random variables with unbounded variances. Such bounds
  are very useful in inferring properties of large networks using few samples.'
