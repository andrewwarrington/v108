title: 'Scaling up Kernel Ridge Regression via Locality Sensitive Hashing '
abstract: Random binning features, introduced in the seminal paper of Rahimi and Recht
  â€™07, are an efficient method for approximating a kernel matrix using locality sensitive
  hashing. Random binning features provide a very simple and efficient way to approximate
  the Laplace kernel but unfortunately do not apply to many important classes of kernels,
  notably ones that generate smooth Gaussian processes, such as the Gaussian kernel
  and Matern kernel. In this paper we introduce a simple weighted version of random
  binning features, and show that the corresponding kernel function generates Gaussian
  processes of any desired smoothness. We show that our weighted random binning features
  provide a spectral approximation to the corresponding kernel matrix, leading to
  efficient algorithms for kernel ridge regression. Experiments on large scale regression
  datasets show that our method outperforms the accuracy of random Fourier features
  method.
