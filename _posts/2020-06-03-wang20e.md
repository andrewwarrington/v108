title: Deontological Ethics By Monotonicity Shape Constraints
abstract: 'We demonstrate how easy it is for modern machine-learned systems to violate
  common deontological ethical principles and social norms such as “favor the less
  fortunate,” and “do not penalize good attributes.” We propose that in some cases
  such ethical principles can be incorporated into a machine-learned model by adding
  shape constraints that constrain the model to respond only positively to relevant
  inputs. We analyze the relationship between these deontological constraints that
  act on individuals and the consequentialist group-based fairness goals of one-sided
  statistical parity and equal opportunity.  This strategy works with sensitive attributes
  that are Boolean or real-valued such as income and age, and can help produce more
  responsible and trustworthy AI. '
