title: A Topology Layer for Machine Learning
abstract: 'Topology applied to real world data using persistent homology has started
  to find applications within machine learning, including deep learning. We present
  a differentiable topology layer that computes persistent homology based on level
  set filtrations and edge-based filtrations. We present three  novel applications:
  the topological layer can (i) regularize data reconstruction or the weights of machine
  learning models, (ii) construct a loss on the output of a deep generative network
  to incorporate topological priors, and (iii) perform topological adversarial attacks
  on deep networks trained with persistence features. The code is publicly available
  and we hope its availability will facilitate the use of persistent homology in deep
  learning and other gradient based applications. '
