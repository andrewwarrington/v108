title: 'Linear predictor on linearly-generated data with missing values: non consistency
  and solutions'
abstract: We consider building predictors when the data have missing values. We study
  the seemingly-simple case where the target to predict is a linear function of the
  fully observed data and we show that, in the presence of missing values, the optimal
  predictor is not linear in general. In the particular Gaussian case, it can be written
  as a linear function of multiway interactions between the observed data and the
  various missing value indicators. Due to its intrinsic complexity, we study a simple
  approximation and prove generalization bounds with finite samples, highlighting
  regimes for which each method performs best. We then show that multilayer perceptrons
  with ReLU activation functions can be consistent, and can explore good trade-offs
  between the true model and approximations. Our study highlights the interesting
  family of models that are beneficial to fit with missing values depending on the
  amount of data available.
