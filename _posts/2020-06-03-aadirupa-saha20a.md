title: Best-item Learning in Random Utility Models with Subset Choices
abstract: 'We consider the problem of PAC learning the most valuable item from a pool
  of $n$ items using sequential, adaptively chosen plays of subsets of $k$ items,
  when, upon playing a subset, the learner receives relative feedback sampled according
  to a general Random Utility Model (RUM) with independent noise perturbations to
  the latent item utilities. We identify a new property of such a RUM, termed the
  minimum advantage, that helps in characterizing the complexity of separating pairs
  of items based on their relative win/loss empirical counts, and can be bounded as
  a function of the noise distribution alone. We give a learning algorithm for general
  RUMs, based on pairwise relative counts of items and hierarchical elimination, along
  with a new PAC sample complexity guarantee of $O(\frac{n}{c^2\epsilon^2} \log \frac{k}{\delta})$
  rounds to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal item with confidence $1-\delta$, when the
  worst case pairwise advantage in the RUM has sensitivity at least $c$ to the parameter
  gaps of items. Fundamental lower bounds on PAC sample complexity show that this
  is near-optimal in terms of its dependence on $n,k$ and $c$. '
