title: Active Community Detection with Maximal Expected Model Change
abstract: We present a novel active learning algorithm for community detection on
  networks. Our proposed algorithm uses a Maximal Expected Model Change (MEMC) criterion
  for querying network nodes label assignments. MEMC detects nodes that maximally
  change the community assignment likelihood model following a query. Our method is
  inspired by detection in the benchmark Stochastic Block Model (SBM), where we provide  sample
  complexity analysis and empirical study with SBM and real network data for binary
  as well as for the multi-class settings. The analysis also covers the most challenging
  case of sparse degree and below-detection-threshold SBMs, where we observe a super-linear
  error reduction. MEMC is shown to be superior to the random selection baseline and
  other state-of-the-art active learners.
