title: 'AsyncQVI: Asynchronous-Parallel Q-Value Iteration for Discounted Markov Decision
  Processes with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity'
abstract: In this paper, we propose AsyncQVI, an asynchronous-parallel Q-value iteration
  for discounted Markov decision processes whose transition and reward can only be
  sampled through a generative model. AsyncQVI is also the first asynchronous-parallel
  algorithm for discounted Markov decision processes that has a sample complexity,
  which nearly matches the theoretical lower bound. The relatively low memory footprint
  and parallel ability make AsyncQVI suitable for large-scale applications. In numerical
  tests, we compare AsyncQVI with four sample-based value iteration methods. The results
  show that our algorithm is highly efficient and achieves linear parallel speedup.
