title: Robust Stackelberg buyers in repeated auctions
abstract: 'We consider the practical and classical setting where the seller is using
  an exploration stage to learn the value distributions of the bidders before running
  a revenue-maximizing auction in a exploitation phase. In this two-stage process,
  we exhibit practical, simple and robust strategies with large utility uplifts for
  the bidders. We quantify precisely the seller revenue against non-discounted buyers,
  complementing recent studies that had focused on impatient/heavily discounted buyers.
  We also prove the robustness of these shading strategies to sample approximation
  error of the seller, to bidderâ€™s approximation error of the competition and to possible
  change of the mechanisms.   '
