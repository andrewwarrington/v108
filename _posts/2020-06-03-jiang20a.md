title: Identifying and Correcting Label Bias in Machine Learning
abstract: Datasets often contain biases which unfairly disadvantage certain groups,
  and classifiers trained on such datasets can inherit these biases. In this paper,
  we provide a mathematical formulation of how this bias can arise. We do so by assuming
  the existence of underlying, unknown, and unbiased labels which are overwritten
  by an agent who intends to provide accurate labels but may have biases against certain
  groups. Despite the fact that we only observe the biased labels, we are able to
  show that the bias may nevertheless be corrected by re-weighting the data points
  without changing the labels. We show, with theoretical guarantees, that training
  on the re-weighted dataset corresponds to training on the unobserved but unbiased
  labels, thus leading to an unbiased machine learning classifier. Our procedure is
  fast and robust and can be used with virtually any learning algorithm. We evaluate
  on a number of standard machine learning fairness datasets and a variety of fairness
  notions, finding that our method outperforms standard approaches in achieving fair
  classification.
