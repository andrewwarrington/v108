title: Gaussianization Flows
abstract: Iterative Gaussianization is a fixed-point iteration procedure that allows
  one to transform a continuous distribution to Gaussian distribution. Based on iterative
  Gaussianization, we propose a new type of normalizing flow models that grants both
  efficient computation of likelihoods and efficient inversion for sample generation.
  We demonstrate that this new family of flow models, named as Gaussianization flows,
  are universal approximators for continuous probability distributions under some
  regularity conditions. This guaranteed expressivity, enabling them to capture multimodal
  target distributions better without compromising the efficiency in sample generation.
  Experimentally, we show that Gaussianization flows achieve better or comparable
  performance on several tabular datasets, compared to other efficiently invertible
  flow models such as Real NVP, Glow and FFJORD. In particular, Gaussianization flows
  are easier to initialize, demonstrate better robustness with respect to different
  transformations of the training data, and generalize better on small training sets.
