title: Obfuscation via Information Density Estimation
abstract: Identifying features that leak information about sensitive attributes is
  a key challenge in the design of information obfuscation mechanisms. In this paper,
  we propose a framework to identify information-leaking features via information
  density estimation. Here, features whose information densities exceed a pre-defined
  threshold are deemed information-leaking features. Once these features are identified,
  we sequentially pass them through a targeted obfuscation mechanism with a provable
  leakage guarantee in terms of $\mathsf{E}_\gamma$-divergence. The core of this mechanism
  relies on a data-driven estimate of the trimmed information density for which we
  propose a novel estimator, named the \textit{trimmed information density estimator}
  (TIDE). We then use TIDE to implement our mechanism on three real-world datasets.
  Our approach can be used as a data-driven pipeline for designing obfuscation mechanisms
  targeting specific features.
