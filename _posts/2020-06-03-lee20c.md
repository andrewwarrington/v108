title: Prior-aware Composition Inference for Spectral Topic Models
abstract: 'Spectral algorithms operate on matrices or tensors of word co-occurrence
  to learn latent topics. These approaches remove the dependence on the original documents
  and produce substantial gains in efficiency with provable inference, but at a cost:
  the models can no longer infer any information about individual documents. Thresholded
  Linear Inverse is developed to learn document-specific topic compositions, but its
  linear characteristics limit the inference quality without considering any prior
  information on topic distributions. We propose two novel estimation methods that
  respect previously unclear prior structures of spectral topic models. Experiments
  on a variety of synthetic to real collections demonstrate that our Prior-Aware Dual
  Decomposition outperforms the baseline method, whereas our Prior-Aware Manifold
  Iteration performs even better on short realistic data.'
