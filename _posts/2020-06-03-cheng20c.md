title: Patient-Specific Effects of Medication Using Latent Force Models with Gaussian
  Processes
abstract: 'A multi-output Gaussian process (GP) is a flexible Bayesian nonparametric
  framework that has proven useful in jointly modeling the physiological states of
  patients in medical time series data. However, capturing the short-term effects
  of drugs and therapeutic interventions on patient physiological state remains challenging.
  We propose a novel approach that models the effect of interventions as a hybrid
  Gaussian process composed of a GP capturing patient baseline physiology convolved
  with a latent force model capturing effects of treatments on specific physiological
  features. The combination of a multi-output GP with a time-marked kernel GP leads
  to a well-characterized model of patientsâ€™ physiological state across a hospital
  stay, including response to interventions. Our model leads to analytically tractable
  cross-covariance functions that allow for scalable inference. Our hierarchical model
  includes estimates of patient-specific effects but allows sharing of support across
  patients. Our approach achieves competitive predictive performance on challenging
  hospital data, where we recover patient-specific response to the administration
  of three common drugs: one antihypertensive drug and two anticoagulants.'
