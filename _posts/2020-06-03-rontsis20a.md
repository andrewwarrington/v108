title: Optimal Approximation of Doubly Stochastic Matrices
abstract: We consider the least-squares approximation of a matrix C in the set of
  doubly stochastic matrices with the same sparsity pattern as C. Our approach is
  based on applying the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
  to a reformulation of the original problem. Our resulting algorithm requires an
  initial Cholesky factorization of a positive definite matrix that has the same sparsity
  pattern as C + I followed by simple iterations whose complexity is linear in the
  number of nonzeros in C, thus ensuring excellent scalability and speed. We demonstrate
  the advantages of our approach in a series of experiments on problems with up to
  82 million nonzeros; these include normalizing large scale matrices arising from
  the 3D structure of the human genome, clustering applications, and the SuiteSparse
  matrix library. Overall, our experiments illustrate the outstanding scalability
  of our algorithm; matrices with millions of nonzeros can be approximated in a few
  seconds on modest desktop computing hardware.
