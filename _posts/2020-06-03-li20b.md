title: Robust Importance Weighting for  Covariate Shift
abstract: In many learning problems, the training and testing data follow different
  distributions and a particularly common situation is the \textit{covariate shift}.
  To correct for sampling biases, most approaches, including the popular kernel mean
  matching (KMM), focus on estimating the importance weights between the two distributions.
  Reweighting-based methods, however, are exposed to high variance when the distributional
  discrepancy is large. On the other hand, the alternate approach of using nonparametric
  regression (NR) incurs high bias when the training size is limited. In this paper,
  we propose and analyze a new estimator that systematically integrates the residuals
  of NR with KMM reweighting, based on a  control-variate perspective. The proposed
  estimator can be shown to either strictly outperform or match the best-known existing
  rates for both KMM and NR, and thus is a robust combination of both estimators.
  The experiments shows the estimator works well in practice.
