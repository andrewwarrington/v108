title: 'Approximate Cross-validation: Guarantees for Model Assessment and Selection'
abstract: 'Cross-validation (CV) is a popular approach for assessing and selecting
  predictive models. However, when the number of folds is large, CV suffers from a
  need to repeatedly refit a learning procedure on a large number of training datasets.
  Recent work in empirical risk minimization (ERM) approximates the expensive refitting
  with a single Newton step warm-started from the full training set optimizer. While
  this can greatly reduce runtime, several open questions remain including whether
  these approximations lead to faithful model selection and whether they are suitable
  for non-smooth objectives. We address these questions with three main contributions:
  (i) we provide uniform non-asymptotic, deterministic model assessment guarantees
  for approximate CV; (ii) we show that (roughly) the same conditions also guarantee
  model selection performance comparable to CV; (iii) we provide a proximal Newton
  extension of the approximate CV framework for non-smooth prediction problems and
  develop improved assessment guarantees for problems such as L1-regularized ERM.'
