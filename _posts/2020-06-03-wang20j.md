title: A Wasserstein Minimum Velocity Approach to Learning Unnormalized Models
abstract: Score matching provides an effective approach to learning flexible unnormalized
  models, but its scalability is limited by the need to evaluate a second-order derivative.
  In this paper, we present a scalable approximation to a general family of learning
  objectives including score matching, by observing a new connection between these
  objectives and Wasserstein gradient flows. We present applications with promise
  in learning neural density estimators on manifolds, and training implicit variational
  and Wasserstein auto-encoders with a manifold-valued prior.
