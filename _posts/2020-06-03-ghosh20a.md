title: Alternating Minimization Converges Super-Linearly for  Mixed Linear Regression
abstract: We address the problem of solving mixed random linear equations. In this
  problem, we have unlabeled observations coming from multiple linear regressions,
  and each observation corresponds to exactly one of the regression models. The goal
  is to learn the linear regressors from the observations. Classically, Alternating
  Minimization (AM) (which may be thought as a variant of Expectation Maximization
  (EM)) is used to solve this problem. AM iteratively alternates between the estimation
  of labels and solving the regression problems with the estimated labels. Empirically,
  it is observed that, for a large variety of non-convex problems including mixed
  linear regression, AM converges at a much faster rate compared to gradient based
  algorithms. However, the existing theory suggests similar rate of convergence, failing
  to capture this empirical behavior. In this paper, we close this gap between theory
  and practice for the special case of a mixture of $2$ linear regressions.  We show
  that, provided initialized properly, AM enjoys a \emph{super-linear} rate of convergence.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically establishes
  such rate for AM. Hence, if we want to recover the unknown regressors upto an error
  (in $\ell_2$ norm) of $\epsilon$, AM only takes $\mathcal{O}(\log \log (1/\epsilon))$
  iterations.
