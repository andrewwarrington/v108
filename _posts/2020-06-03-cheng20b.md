title: A Reduction from Reinforcement Learning to No-Regret Online Learning
abstract: 'We present a reduction from reinforcement learning (RL) to no-regret online
  learning based on the saddle-point formulation of RL, by which "any" online algorithm
  with sublinear regret can generate policies with provable performance guarantees.
  This new perspective decouples the RL problem into two parts: regret minimization
  and function approximation. The first part admits a standard online-learning analysis,
  and the second part can be quantified independently of the learning algorithm. Therefore,
  the proposed reduction can be used as a tool to systematically design new RL algorithms.
  We demonstrate this idea by devising a simple RL algorithm based on mirror descent
  and the generative-model oracle. For any $\gamma$-discounted tabular RL problem,
  with probability at least $1-\delta$, it learns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy using
  at most $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{|\SS||Å|\log(\frac{1}{\delta})}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$
  samples. Furthermore, this algorithm admits a direct extension to linearly parameterized
  function approximators for large-scale applications, with computation and sample
  complexities independent of $|\SS|$,$|Å|$, though at the cost of potential approximation
  bias.'
