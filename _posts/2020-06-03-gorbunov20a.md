title: 'A Unified Theory of SGD: Variance Reduction, Sampling, Quantization and Coordinate
  Descent'
abstract: 'In this paper we introduce a unified analysis of a large family of variants
  of proximal stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which so far have required different
  intuitions, convergence analyses, have different applications, and which have been
  developed separately in various communities. We show that our framework includes
  methods with and without the following tricks, and their combinations: variance
  reduction, importance sampling, mini-batch sampling, quantization, and coordinate
  sub-sampling.  As a by-product, we obtain the first unified theory of SGD and randomized
  coordinate descent (RCD) methods,  the first unified theory of variance reduced
  and non-variance-reduced SGD methods, and the first unified theory of quantized
  and non-quantized methods. A key to our approach is a parametric assumption on the
  iterates and stochastic gradients. In a single theorem we establish a linear convergence
  result under this assumption and strong-quasi convexity of the loss function. Whenever
  we recover an existing method as a special case, our theorem gives the best known
  complexity result. Our approach can be  used to motivate the development of new
  useful methods, and offers pre-proved convergence guarantees. To illustrate the
  strength of our approach, we develop five new variants of SGD, and through numerical
  experiments demonstrate some of their properties.  '
