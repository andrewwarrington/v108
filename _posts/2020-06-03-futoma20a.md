title: 'POPCORN: Partially Observed Prediction Constrained Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Many medical decision-making tasks can be framed as partially observed Markov
  decision processes (POMDPs). However, prevailing two-stage approaches that first
  learn a POMDP and then solve it often fail because the model that best fits the
  data may not be well suited for planning. We introduce a new optimization objective
  that (a) produces both high-performing policies and high-quality generative models,
  even when some observations are irrelevant for planning, and (b) does so in batch
  off-policy settings that are typical in healthcare, when only retrospective data
  is available. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic examples and a challenging
  medical decision-making problem.
