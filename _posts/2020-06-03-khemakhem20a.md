title: 'Variational Autoencoders and Nonlinear ICA: A Unifying Framework'
abstract: 'The framework of variational autoencoders allows us to efficiently learn
  deep latent-variable models, such that the model’s marginal distribution over observed
  variables fits the data. Often, we’re interested in going a step further, and want
  to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables, including
  the true prior and posterior distributions over latent variables. This is known
  to be generally impossible due to unidentifiability of the model. We address this
  issue by showing that for a broad family of deep latent-variable models, identification
  of the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible
  up to  very simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form
  of disentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the
  latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such
  as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent developments
  in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy, undercomplete or discrete
  observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood framework. The result also trivially
  contains identifiable flow-based generative models as a special case. '
