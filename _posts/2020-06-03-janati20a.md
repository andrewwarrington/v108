title: 'Spatio-temporal alignments: Optimal transport through space and time'
abstract: "    Comparing data defined over space and time is notoriously hard. It
  involves quantifying both spatial and temporal variability while taking into account
  the chronological structure of the data. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) computes a minimal
  cost alignment between time series that preserves the chronological order but is
  inherently blind to spatio-temporal shifts. In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal
  Alignments (STA), a new differentiable formulation of DTW that captures spatial
  and temporal variability. Spatial differences between time samples are captured
  using regularized Optimal transport. While temporal alignment cost exploits a smooth
  variant of DTW called soft-DTW. We show how smoothing DTW leads to alignment costs
  that increase quadratically with time shifts. The costs are expressed using an unbalanced
  Wasserstein distance to cope with observations that are not probabilities. Experiments
  on handwritten letters and brain imaging data confirm our theoretical findings and
  illustrate the effectiveness of STA as a dissimilarity for spatio-temporal data."
