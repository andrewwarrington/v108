title: On Thompson Sampling for Smoother-than-Lipschitz Bandits
abstract: 'Thompson Sampling is a well established approach to bandit and reinforcement
  learning problems. However its use in continuum armed bandit problems has received
  relatively little attention. We  provide the first bounds on the regret of Thompson
  Sampling for continuum armed bandits under weak conditions on the function class
  containing the true function and sub-exponential observation noise. The eluder dimension
  is a recently proposed measure of the complexity of a function class, which has
  been demonstrated to be useful in bounding the Bayesian regret of Thompson Sampling
  for simpler bandit problems under sub-Gaussian observation noise. We derive a new
  bound on the eluder dimension for classes of functions with Lipschitz derivatives,
  and generalise previous analyses in multiple regards. '
