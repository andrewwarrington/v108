title: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Swindles
abstract: 'Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  algorithm for estimating expectations with respect to continuous un-normalized probability
  distributions. MCMC estimators typically have higher variance than classical Monte
  Carlo with i.i.d. samples due to autocorrelations; most MCMC research tries to reduce
  these autocorrelations. In this work, we explore a complementary approach to variance
  reduction based on two classical Monte Carlo ’swindles’: first, running an auxiliary
  coupled chain targeting a tractable approximation to the target distribution, and
  using the auxiliary samples as control variates; and second, generating anti-correlated
  ("antithetic") samples by running two chains with flipped randomness. Both ideas
  have been explored previously in the context of Gibbs samplers and random-walk Metropolis
  algorithms, but we argue that they are ripe for adaptation to HMC in light of recent
  coupling results from the HMC theory literature. For many posterior distributions,
  we find that these swindles generate effective sample sizes orders of magnitude
  larger than plain HMC, as well as being more efficient than analogous swindles for
  Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and random-walk Metropolis. '
