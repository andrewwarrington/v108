title: The Implicit Regularization of Ordinary Least Squares Ensembles
abstract: Ensemble methods that average over a collection of independent predictors
  that are each limited to a subsampling of both the examples and features of the
  training data command a significant presence in machine learning, such as the ever-popular
  random forest, yet the nature of the subsampling effect, particularly of the features,
  is not well understood. We study the case of an ensemble of linear predictors, where
  each individual predictor is fit using ordinary least squares on a random submatrix
  of the data matrix. We show that, under standard Gaussianity assumptions, when the
  number of features selected for each predictor is optimally tuned, the asymptotic
  risk of a large ensemble is equal to the asymptotic ridge regression risk, which
  is known to be optimal among linear predictors in this setting. In addition to eliciting
  this implicit regularization that results from subsampling, we also connect this
  ensemble to the dropout technique used in training deep (neural) networks, another
  strategy that has been shown to have a ridge-like regularizing effect.
