title: Precision-Recall Curves Using Information Divergence Frontiers
abstract: Despite the tremendous progress in the estimation of generative models,
  the development of tools for diagnosing their failures and assessing their performance
  has advanced at a much slower pace. Recent developments have investigated metrics
  that quantify which parts of the true distribution is modeled well, and, on the
  contrary, what the model fails to capture, akin to precision and recall in information
  retrieval. In this paper, we present a general evaluation framework for generative
  models that measures the trade-off between precision and recall using Renyi divergences.
  Our framework provides a novel perspective on existing techniques and extends them
  to more general domains. As a key advantage, this formulation encompasses both continuous
  and discrete models and allows for the design of efficient algorithms that do not
  have to quantize the data. We further analyze the biases of the approximations used
  in practice.
