title: Federated Heavy Hitters Discovery with Differential Privacy
abstract: The discovery of heavy hitters (most frequent items) in user-generated data
  streams drives improvements in the app and web ecosystems, but can incur substantial
  privacy risks if not done with care. To address these risks, we propose a distributed
  and privacy-preserving algorithm for discovering the heavy hitters in a population
  of user-generated data streams. We leverage the sampling and thresholding properties
  of our distributed algorithm to prove that it is inherently differentially private,
  without requiring additional noise. We also examine the trade-off between privacy
  and utility, and show that our algorithm provides excellent utility while also achieving
  strong privacy guarantees. A significant advantage of this approach is that it eliminates
  the need to centralize raw data while also avoiding the significant loss in utility
  incurred by local differential privacy. We validate our findings both theoretically,
  using worst-case analyses, and practically, using a Twitter dataset with 1.6M tweets
  and over 650k users. Finally, we carefully compare our approach to Appleâ€™s local
  differential privacy method for discovering heavy hitters.
