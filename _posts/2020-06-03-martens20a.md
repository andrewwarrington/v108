title: 'Neural Decomposition: Functional ANOVA with Variational Autoencoders'
abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a popular approach for dimensionality
  reduction. However, despite their ability to identify latent low-dimensional structures
  embedded within high-dimensional data, these latent representations are typically
  hard to interpret on their own. Due to the black-box nature of VAEs, their utility
  for healthcare and genomics applications has been limited. In this paper, we focus
  on characterising the sources of variation in Conditional VAEs. Our goal is to provide
  a feature-level variance decomposition, i.e. to decompose variation in the data
  by separating out the marginal additive effects of latent variables z and fixed
  inputs c from their non-linear interactions. We propose to achieve this through
  what we call Neural Decomposition – an adaptation of the well-known concept of functional
  ANOVA variance decomposition from classical statistics to deep learning models.
  We show how identifiability can be achieved by training models subject to constraints
  on the marginal properties of the decoder networks. We demonstrate the utility of
  our Neural Decomposition on a series of synthetic examples as well as high-dimensional
  genomics data.
