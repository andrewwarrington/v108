title: Unconditional Coresets for Regularized Loss Minimization
abstract: We design and mathematically analyze sampling-based algorithms for regularized
  loss minimization problems that are implementable in popular computational models
  for large data, in which the access to the data is restricted in some way. Our main
  result is that if the regularizerâ€™s effect does not become negligible as the norm
  of the hypothesis scales, and as the data scales, then a uniform sample of modest
  size is with high probability a coreset. In the case that the loss function is either
  logistic regression or soft-margin support vector machines, and the regularizer
  is one of the common recommended choices, this result implies that a uniform sample
  of size $O(d \sqrt{n})$ is with high probability a coreset of $n$ points in $\Re^d$.
  We contrast this upper bound with two lower bounds. The first lower bound shows
  that our analysis of uniform sampling is tight; that is,  a smaller uniform sample
  will likely not be a core set. The second lower bound shows that in some sense uniform
  sampling is close to optimal, as significantly smaller core sets do not generally
  exist.
