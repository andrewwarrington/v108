title: An Optimal Algorithm for Bandit Convex Optimization with Strongly-Convex and
  Smooth Loss
abstract: We consider non-stochastic bandit convex optimization with strongly-convex
  and smooth loss functions. For this problem, Hazan and Levy have proposed an algorithm
  with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ given access to an $O(d)$-self-concordant
  barrier over the feasible region, where $d$ and $T$ stand for the dimensionality
  of the feasible region and the number of rounds, respectively. However, there are
  no known efficient ways for constructing self-concordant barriers for general convex
  sets, and a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ gap has remained between the upper and lower bounds,
  as the known regret lower bound is $\Omega(d\sqrt{T})$. Our study resolves these
  two issues by introducing an algorithm that achieves an optimal regret bound of
  $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{T})$ under a mild assumption, without self-concordant barriers.
  More precisely, the algorithm requires only a membership oracle for the feasible
  region, and it achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ under
  the assumption that the optimal solution is an interior of the feasible region.
  Even without this assumption, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$-regret.
