title: Robust Variational Autoencoders for Outlier Detection and Repair of Mixed-Type
  Data
abstract: We focus on the problem of unsupervised cell outlier detection and repair
  inmixed-type tabular data. Traditional methods are concerned only with detecting
  which rows in the dataset areoutliers. However, identifying which cells are corrupted
  in aspecific row is an important problem in practice, and the very first steptowards
  repairing them. We introduce the Robust VariationalAutoencoder (RVAE), a deep generative
  model that learns the jointdistribution of the clean data while identifying the
  outlier cells, allowing their imputation (repair). RVAE explicitly learns the probability
  of each cell being an outlier, balancing differentlikelihood models in the row outlier
  score, making the method suitablefor outlier detection in mixed-type datasets.We
  show experimentallythat not only RVAE performs better than several state-of-the-art
  methods incell outlier detection and repair for tabular data, but also that is robust
  against theinitial hyper-parameter selection.
