title: Kernel Conditional Density Operators
abstract: We introduce a novel conditional density estimationmodel termed the conditional
  densityoperator (CDO). It naturally captures multivariate,multimodal output densities
  andshows performance that is competitive withrecent neural conditional density models
  andGaussian processes. The proposed model isbased on a novel approach to the reconstructionof
  probability densities from their kernelmean embeddings by drawing connections toestimation
  of Radon-Nikodym derivatives inthe reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).We prove
  finite sample bounds for the estimationerror in a standard density reconstructionscenario,
  independent of problem dimensionality.Interestingly, when a kernel is used thatis
  also a probability density, the CDO allowsus to both evaluate and sample the outputdensity
  efficiently. We demonstrate the versatilityand performance of the proposed modelon
  both synthetic and real-world data.
