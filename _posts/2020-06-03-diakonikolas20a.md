title: Locally Accelerated Conditional Gradients
abstract: 'Conditional gradients constitute a class of projection-free first-order
  algorithms for smooth convex optimization. As such, they are frequently used in
  solving smooth convex optimization problems over polytopes, for which the computational
  cost of projections is prohibitive. However, they do not enjoy the optimal convergence
  rates achieved by projection-based accelerated methods; moreover, achieving such
  globally-accelerated rates is information-theoretically impossible. To address this
  issue, we present Locally Accelerated Conditional Gradients â€“ an algorithmic framework
  that couples accelerated steps with conditional gradient steps to achieve \emph{local}
  acceleration on smooth strongly convex problems. Our approach does not require projections
  onto the feasible set, but only on (typically low-dimensional) simplices, thus keeping
  the computational cost of projections at bay. Further, it achieves optimal accelerated
  local convergence. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments,
  which demonstrate significant speedups over state of the art methods in both per-iteration
  progress and wall-clock time. '
