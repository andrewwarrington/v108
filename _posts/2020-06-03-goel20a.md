title: Learning Ising and Potts Models with Latent Variables
abstract: 'We study the problem of learning graphical models with latent variables.
  We give the {\em first} efficient algorithms for learning: 1) ferromagnetic Ising
  models with latent variables under {\em arbitrary} external fields, and 2) ferromagnetic
  Potts model with latent variables under unidirectional non-negative external field.
  Our algorithms have optimal dependence on the dimension but suffer from a sub-optimal
  dependence on the underlying sparsity of the graph.Our results rely on two structural
  properties of the underlying graphical models. These in turn allow us to design
  an influence function which can be maximized greedily to recover the structure of
  the underlying graphical model. These structural results may be of independent interest.'
