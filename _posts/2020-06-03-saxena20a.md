title: Thompson Sampling for Linearly Constrained Bandits
abstract: We address multi-armed bandits (MAB) where the objective is to maximize
  the cumulative reward under a probabilistic linear constraint. For a few real-world
  instances of this problem, constrained extensions of the well-known Thompson Sampling
  (TS) heuristic have recently been proposed. However, finite-time analysis of constrained
  TS is challenging; as a result, only O( sqrt( T ) ) bounds on the cumulative reward
  loss (i.e., the regret) are available. In this paper, we describe LinConTS, a TS-based
  algorithm for bandits that place a linear constraint on the probability of earning
  a reward in every round. We show that for LinConTS, the regret as well as the cumulative
  constraint violations are upper bounded by O( log ( T ) ). We develop a proof technique
  that relies on careful analysis of the dual problem and combine it with recent theoretical
  work on unconstrained TS. Through numerical experiments on two real-world datasets,
  we demonstrate that LinConTS outperforms an asymptotically optimal upper confidence
  bound (UCB) scheme in terms of simultaneously minimizing the regret and the violation.
