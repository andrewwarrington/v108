title: Private k-Means Clustering with Stability Assumptions
abstract: We study the problem of differentially private clustering under input-stability
  assumptions. Despite the ever-growing volume of works on differential privacy in
  general and differentially private clustering in particular, only three works (Nissim
  et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015; Huang and Liu, 2018) looked at the problem of privately
  clustering "nice" k-means instances, all three relying on the sample-and-aggregate
  framework and all three measuring utility in terms of Wasserstein distance between
  the true cluster centers and the centers returned by the private algorithm. In this
  work we improve upon this line of works on multiple axes. We present a simpler algorithm
  for clustering stable inputs (not relying on the sample-and-aggregate framework),
  and analyze its utility in both the Wasserstein distance and the k-means cost. Moreover,
  our algorithm has straight-forward analogues for "nice" k-median instances and for
  the local-model of differential privacy.
