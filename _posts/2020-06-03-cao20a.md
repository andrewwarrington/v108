title: Better Long-Range Dependency By Bootstrapping A Mutual Information Regularizer
abstract: In this work, we develop a novel regularizer to improve the learning of
  long-range dependency of sequence data. Applied on language modelling, our regularizer
  expresses the inductive bias that sequence variables should have high mutual information
  even though the model might not see abundant observations for complex long-range
  dependency. We show how the â€œnext sentence prediction (classification)" heuristic
  can be derived in a principled way from our mutual information estimation framework,
  and be further extended to maximize the mutual information of sequence variables.
  The proposed approach not only is effective at increasing the mutual information
  of segments under the learned model but more importantly, leads to a higher likelihood
  on holdout data, and improved generation quality.  Code is releasedat https://github.com/BorealisAI/BMI.
