title: 'GAIT: A Geometric Approach to Information Theory'
abstract: 'We advocate the use of a notion of entropy that reflects the relative abundances
  of the symbols in an alphabet, as well as the similarities between them. This concept
  was originally introduced in theoretical ecology to study the diversity of ecosystems.
  Based on this notion of entropy, we introduce geometry-aware counterparts for several
  concepts and theorems in information theory. Notably, our proposed divergence exhibits
  performance on par with state-of-the-art methods based on the Wasserstein distance,
  but enjoys a closed-form expression that can be computed efficiently. We demonstrate
  the versatility of our method via experiments on a broad range of domains: training
  generative models, computing image barycenters, approximating empirical measures
  and counting modes.'
