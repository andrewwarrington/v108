title: Approximate Inference in Discrete Distributions with Monte Carlo Tree Search
  and Value Functions
abstract: Exact probabilistic inference in discrete models is often prohibitively
  expensive, as it may require evaluating the (unnormalized) target density on its
  entire domain. Here we consider the setting where only a limited budget of calls
  to the unnormalized target density oracle is available, raising the challenge of
  where in its domain to allocate these function calls in order to construct a good
  approximate solution. We formulate this problem as an instance of sequential decision-making
  under uncertainty and leverage methods from reinforcement learning for probabilistic
  inference with budget constraints. In particular, we propose the TreeSample algorithm,
  an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search to approximate inference. This algorithm
  caches all previous queries to the density oracle in an explicit search tree, and
  dynamically allocates new queries based on a "best-first" heuristic for exploration,
  using existing upper confidence bound methods. Our non-parametric inference method
  can be effectively combined with neural networks that compile approximate conditionals
  of the target, which are then used to guide the inference search and enable generalization
  of across multiple target distributions. We show empirically that TreeSample outperforms
  standard approximate inference methods on synthetic factor graphs.
