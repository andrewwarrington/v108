title: The Gossiping Insert-Eliminate Algorithm for Multi-Agent Bandits
abstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting
  of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret.
  In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip
  style communications. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays
  from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend
  only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play.
  We establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any connected
  pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agentâ€™s regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller
  compared to the case of no collaborations.  Furthermore, we show that the communication
  constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then
  analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication
  tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the
  insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound
  which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved
  even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results demonstrate that
  even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all
  agents.
