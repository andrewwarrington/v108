title: Characterization of Overlap in Observational Studies
abstract: Overlap between treatment groups is required for non-parametric estimation
  of causal effects.  If a subgroup of subjects always receives the same intervention,
  we cannot estimate the effect of intervention changes on that subgroup without further
  assumptions.  When overlap does not hold globally, characterizing local regions
  of overlap can inform the relevance of causal conclusions for new subjects, and
  can help guide additional data collection. To have impact, these descriptions must
  be interpretable for downstream users who are not machine learning experts, such
  as policy makers.  We formalize overlap estimation as a problem of finding minimum
  volume sets subject to coverage constraints and reduce this problem to binary classification
  with Boolean rule classifiers. We then generalize this method to estimate overlap
  in off-policy policy evaluation. In several real-world applications, we demonstrate
  that these rules have comparable accuracy to black-box estimators and provide intuitive
  and informative explanations that can inform policy making.
