title: Adaptive Exploration in Linear Contextual Bandit
abstract: Contextual bandits serve as a fundamental model for many sequential decision
  making tasks. The most popular theoretically justified approaches are based on the
  optimism principle and Thompson sampling. While these algorithms can be practical,
  they are known to be suboptimal asymptotically. On the other hand, existing asymptotically
  optimal algorithms for this problem do not exploit the linear structure in an optimal
  way and suffer from lower-order terms that dominate the regret in all practically
  interesting regimes. We start to bridge the gap by designing an algorithm that is
  asymptotically optimal and has good finite-time empirical performance. At the same
  time, we make connections to the recent literature on when exploration-free methods
  are effective. Indeed, if the distribution of contexts is well behaved, then our
  algorithm acts mostly greedily and enjoys sub-logarithmic regret. Furthermore, our
  approach is adaptive in the sense that it automatically detects the nice case. Numerical
  results demonstrate significant regret reductions by our method relative to several
  baselines.
