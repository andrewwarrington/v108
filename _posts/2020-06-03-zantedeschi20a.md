title: Fully Decentralized Joint Learning of Personalized Models and Collaboration
  Graphs
abstract: We consider the fully decentralized machine learning scenario where many
  users with personal datasets collaborate to learn models through local peer-to-peer
  exchanges, without a central coordinator. We propose to train personalized models
  that leverage a collaboration graph describing the relationships between user personal
  tasks, which we learn jointly with the models. Our fully decentralized optimization
  procedure alternates between training nonlinear models given the graph in a greedy
  boosting manner, and updating the collaboration graph (with controlled sparsity)
  given the models. Throughout the process, users exchange messages only with a small
  number of peers (their direct neighbors when updating the models, and a few random
  users when updating the graph), ensuring that the procedure naturally scales with
  the number of users. Overall, our approach is communication-efficient and avoids
  exchanging personal data. We provide an extensive analysis of the convergence rate,
  memory and communication complexity of our approach, and demonstrate its benefits
  compared to competing techniques on synthetic and real datasets.
