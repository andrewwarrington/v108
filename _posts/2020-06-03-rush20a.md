title: An Asymptotic Rate for the LASSO Loss
abstract: The LASSO is a well-studied method for use in high-dimensional linear regression
  where one wishes to recover a sparse vector b from noisy observations y measured
  through a n-by-p matrix X with the model y = Xb + w where w is a vector of independent,
  mean-zero noise.  We study the linear asymptotic regime where the under sampling
  ratio, n/p, approaches a constant greater than 0 in the limit.Using a carefully
  constructed approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm that converges to the LASSO
  estimator and recent finite sample theoretical performance guarantees for AMP, we
  provide large deviations bounds between various measures of LASSO loss and their
  concentrating values predicted by the AMP state evolution that shows exponentially
  fast convergence (in n) when the measurement matrix X is i.i.d. Gaussian.  This
  work refines previous asymptotic analysis of LASSO loss in [Bayati and Montanari,
  2012].
