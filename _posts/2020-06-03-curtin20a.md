title: 'Rk-means: Fast Clustering for Relational Data'
abstract: Conventional machine learning algorithms cannot be applied until a data
  matrix is available to process. When the data matrix needs to be obtained from a
  relational database via a feature extraction query, the computation cost can be
  prohibitive, as the data matrix may be (much) larger than the total input relation
  size.  This paper introduces Rk-means, or relational k-means algorithm, for clustering
  relational data tuples without having to access the full data matrix. As such, we
  avoid having to run the expensive feature extraction query and storing its output.
  Our algorithm leverages the underlying structures in relational data. It involves
  construction of a small grid coreset of the data matrix for subsequent cluster construction.  This
  gives a constant approximation for the k-means objective, while having asymptotic
  runtime improvements over standard approaches of first running the database query
  and then clustering. Empirical results show orders-of-magnitude speedup, and Rk-means
  can run faster on the database than even just computing the data matrix.
