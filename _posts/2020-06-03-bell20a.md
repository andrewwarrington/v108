title: Private Protocols for U-Statistics in the Local Model and Beyond
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of computing $U$-statistics of degree
  $2$, i.e., quantities that come in the form of averages over pairs of data points,
  in the local model of differential privacy (LDP). The class of $U$-statistics covers
  many statistical estimates of interest, including Gini mean difference, Kendall’s
  tau coefficient and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC), as well as empirical risk measures
  for machine learning problems such as ranking, clustering and metric learning. We
  first introduce an LDP protocol based on quantizing the data into bins and applying
  randomized response, which guarantees an $\epsilon$-LDP estimate with a Mean Squared
  Error (MSE) of $O(1/\sqrt{n}\epsilon)$ under regularity assumptions on the $U$-statistic
  or the data distribution. We then propose a specialized protocol for AUC based on
  a novel use of hierarchical histograms that achieves MSE of $O(\alpha^3/n\epsilon^2)$
  for arbitrary data distribution. We also show that 2-party secure computation allows
  to design a protocol with MSE of $O(1/n\epsilon^2)$, without any assumption on the
  kernel function or data distribution and with total communication linear in the
  number of users $n$. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocols through
  experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
