title: Adversarial Risk Bounds through Sparsity based Compression
abstract: Neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against minor adversarial
  perturbations of their inputs, especially for high dimensional data under $\ell_\infty$
  attacks.To combat this problem, techniques like adversarial training have been employed
  to obtain models that are robust on the training set.However, the robustness of
  such models against adversarial perturbations may not generalize to unseen data.To
  study how robustness generalizes, recent works assume that the inputs have bounded
  $\ell_2$-norm in order to bound the adversarial risk for $\ell_\infty$ attacks with
  no explicit dimension dependence.In this work, we focus on $\ell_\infty$ attacks
  with $\ell_\infty$ bounded inputs and prove margin-based bounds.Specifically, we
  use a compression-based approach that relies on efficiently compressing the set
  of tunable parameters without distorting the adversarial risk. To achieve this,
  we apply the concept of effective sparsity and effective joint sparsity on the weight
  matrices of neural networks.This leads to bounds with no explicit dependence on
  the input dimension, neither on the number of classes.Our results show that neural
  networks with approximately sparse weight matrices not only enjoy enhanced robustness
  but also better generalization. Finally, empirical simulations show that the notion
  of effective joint sparsity plays a significant role in generalizing robustness
  to $\ell_\infty$ attacks.
