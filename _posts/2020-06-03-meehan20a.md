title: A Three Sample Hypothesis Test for Evaluating Generative Models
abstract: Detecting overfitting in generative models is an important challenge in
  machine learning. In this work, we formalize a form of overfitting that we call
  {\em{data-copying}} â€“ where the generative model memorizes and outputs training
  samples or small variations thereof. We provide a three sample test for detecting
  data-copying that uses the training set, a separate sample from the target distribution,
  and a generated sample from the model, and study the performance of our test on
  several canonical models and datasets.
