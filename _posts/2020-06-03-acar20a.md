title: Budget Learning via Bracketing
abstract: Conventional machine learning applications in the mobile/IoT setting transmit
  data to a cloud-server for predictions. Due to cost considerations (power, latency,
  monetary), it is desirable to minimise device-to-server transmissions. The budget
  learning (BL) problem poses the learner’s goal as minimising use of the cloud while
  suffering no discernible loss in accuracy, under the constraint that the methods
  employed be edge-implementable. We propose a new formulation for the BL problem
  via the concept of bracketings. Concretely, we propose to sandwich the cloud’s prediction,
  $g,$ via functions $h^-, h^+$ from a ‘simple’ class so that $h^- \le g \le h^+$
  nearly always. On an instance $x$, if $h^+(x)=h^-(x)$, we leverage local processing,
  and bypass the cloud. We explore theoretical aspects of this formulation, providing
  PAC-style learnability definitions; associating the notion of budget learnability
  to approximability via brackets; and giving VC-theoretic analyses of their properties.
  We empirically validate our theory on real-world datasets, demonstrating improved
  performance over prior gating based methods.
