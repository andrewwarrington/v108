title: Domain-Liftability of Relational Marginal Polytopes
abstract: 'We study computational aspects of "relational marginal polytopes" which
  are statistical relational learning counterparts of marginal polytopes, well-known
  from probabilistic graphical models. Here, given some first-order logic formula,
  we can define its relational marginal statistic to be the fraction of groundings
  that make this formula true in a given possible world. For a list of first-order
  logic formulas, the relational marginal polytope is the set of all points that correspond
  to expected values of the relational marginal statistics that are realizable. In
  this paper we study the following two problems: (i) Do domain-liftability results
  for the partition functions of Markov logic networks (MLNs)carry over to the problem
  of relational marginal polytope construction? (ii) Is the relational marginal polytope
  containment problem hard under some plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions?
  Our positive results have consequences for lifted weight learning of MLNs. In particular,
  we show that weight learning of MLNs is domain-liftable whenever the computation
  of the partition function of the respective MLNs is domain-liftable (this result
  has not been rigorously proven before).'
