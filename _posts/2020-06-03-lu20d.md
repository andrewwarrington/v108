title: Ensemble Gaussian Processes with Spectral Features for Online Interactive Learning
  with Scalability
abstract: Combining benefits of kernels with Bayesian models, Gaussian process (GP)
  based approaches have well-documented merits not only in learning over a rich class
  of nonlinear functions, but also quantifying the associated uncertainty. While most
  GP approaches rely on a single preselected prior, the present work employs a weighted
  ensemble of GP priors, each having a unique covariance (kernel) belonging to a prescribed
  kernel dictionary â€“ which leads to a richer space of learning functions. Leveraging
  kernel approximants formed by spectral features for scalability, an online interactive
  ensemble (OI-E) GP framework is developed to jointly learn the sought function,
  and for the first time select interactively the EGP kernel on-the-fly. Performance
  of OI-EGP is benchmarked by the best fixed function estimator via regret analysis.
  Furthermore, the novel OI-EGP is adapted to accommodate dynamic learning functions.
  Synthetic and real data tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.
