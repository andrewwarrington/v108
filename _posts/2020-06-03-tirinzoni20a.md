title: A Novel Confidence-Based Algorithm for Structured Bandits
abstract: We study finite-armed stochastic bandits where the rewards of each arm might
  be correlated to those of other arms. We introduce a novel phased algorithm that
  exploits the given structure to build confidence sets over the parameters of the
  true bandit problem and rapidly discard all sub-optimal arms. In particular, unlike
  standard bandit algorithms with no structure, we show that the number of times a
  suboptimal arm is selected may actually be reduced thanks to the information collected
  by pulling other arms. Furthermore, we show that, in some structures, the regret
  of an anytime extension of our algorithm is uniformly bounded over time. For these
  constant-regret structures, we also derive a matching lower bound. Finally, we demonstrate
  numerically that our approach better exploits certain structures than existing methods.
