title: Scalable Nonparametric Factorization for High-Order Interaction Events
abstract: Interaction events among multiple entities are ubiquitous in real-world
  applications. Although these interactions can be naturally represented by tensors
  and analyzed by tensor decomposition, most existing approaches are limited to multilinear
  decomposition forms, and cannot estimate complex, nonlinear relationships in data.
  More importantly, the existing approaches severely underexploit the time stamps
  information. They either drop/discretize the time stamps or set a local window to
  ignore the long-term dependency between the events. To address these issues, we
  propose a Bayesian nonparametric factorization model for high-order interaction
  events, which can flexibly estimate/embed the static, nonlinear relationships and
  capture various long-term and short-term excitations effects, encoding these effects
  and their decaying patterns into the latent factors.  Specifically, we use the latent
  factors to construct a set of mutually excited Hawkes processes, where we place
  a Gaussian process prior over the background rates to estimate the static, nonlinear
  relationships of the entities and propose novel triggering kernels to embed the
  excitation strengths and their time decaying rates among the interactions. For scalable
  inference, we derive a fully-decomposed model evidence lower bound to dispose of
  the huge covariance matrix and expensive log summation terms. Then we develop an
  efficient stochastic optimization algorithm. We show the advantage of our approach
  in four real-world applications.
