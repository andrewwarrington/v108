title: Truly Batch Model-Free Inverse Reinforcement Learning about Multiple Intentions
abstract: We consider Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) about multiple intentions,
  \ie the problem of estimating the unknown reward functions optimized by a group
  of experts that demonstrate optimal behaviors. Most of the existing algorithms either
  require access to a model of the environment or need to repeatedly compute the optimal
  policies for the hypothesized rewards. However, these requirements are rarely met
  in real-world applications, in which interacting with the environment can be expensive
  or even dangerous. In this paper, we address the IRL about multiple intentions in
  a fully model-free and batch setting. We first cast the single IRL problem as a
  constrained likelihood maximization and then we use this formulation to cluster
  agents based on the likelihood of the assignment. In this way, we can efficiently
  solve, without interactions with the environment, both the IRL and the clustering
  problem. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methodology on simulated domains and
  on a real-world social-network application.
