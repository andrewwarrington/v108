title: Learning High-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models under Total Positivity
  without Adjustment of Tuning Parameters
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating an undirected Gaussian graphical model
  when the underlying distribution is multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2),
  a strong form of positive dependence. Such distributions are relevant for example
  for portfolio selection, since assets are usually positively dependent. A large
  body of methods have been proposed for learning undirected graphical models without
  the MTP2 constraint. A major limitation of these methods is that their structure
  recovery guarantees in the high-dimensional setting usually require a particular
  choice of a tuning parameter, which is unknown a priori in real world applications.
  We here propose a new method to estimate the underlying undirected graphical model
  under MTP2 and show that it is provably consistent in structure recovery without
  adjusting the tuning parameters. This is achieved by a constraint-based estimator
  that infers the structure of the underlying graphical model by testing the signs
  of the empirical partial correlation coefficients. We evaluate the performance of
  our estimator in simulations and on financial data.
