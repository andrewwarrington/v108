title: Non-exchangeable feature allocation models with sublinear growth of the feature
  sizes
abstract: 'Feature allocation models are popular models used in different applications
  such as unsupervised learning or network modeling. In particular, the Indian buffet
  process is a flexible and simple one-parameter feature allocation model where the
  number of features grows unboundedly with the number of objects. The Indian buffet
  process, like most feature allocation models, satisfies a  symmetry property of
  exchangeability: the distribution is invariant under permutation of the objects.
  While this property is desirable in some cases, it has some strong implications.
  Importantly, the number of objects sharing a particular feature grows linearly with
  the number of objects. In this article, we describe a class of non-exchangeable
  feature allocation models where the number of objects sharing a given feature grows
  sublinearly, where the rate can be controlled by a tuning parameter. We derive the
  asymptotic properties of the model, and show that such models provides a better
  fit and better predictive performances on various datasets.'
