title: Nonparametric Estimation in the Dynamic Bradley-Terry Model
abstract: We propose a time-varying generalization of the Bradley-Terry model that
  allows for nonparametric modeling of dynamic global rankings of distinct teams.
  We develop a novel estimator that relies on kernel smoothing to pre-process the
  pairwise comparisons over time and is applicable in sparse settings where the Bradley-Terry
  may not be fit. We obtain  necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
  and uniqueness of our estimator. We also derive time-varying oracle bounds for both
  the estimation error and the excess risk in the model-agnostic setting where the
  Bradley-Terry model is not necessarily the true data generating process.  We thoroughly
  test the practical effectiveness of our model using both simulated and real world
  data and suggest an efficient data-driven approach for bandwidth tuning.
