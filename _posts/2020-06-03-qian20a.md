title: Learning Dynamic and Personalized Comorbidity Networks from Event Data using
  Deep Diffusion Processes
abstract: Comorbid diseases co-occur and progress via complex temporal patterns that
  vary among individuals. In electronic medical records, we only observe onsets of
  diseases, but not their triggering comorbidities — i.e., the mechanisms underlying
  temporal relations between diseases need to be inferred. Learning such temporal
  patterns from event data is crucial for understanding disease pathology and predicting
  prognoses. To this end, we develop deep diffusion processes (DDP) to model ’dynamic
  comorbidity networks’, i.e., the temporal relationships between comorbid disease
  onsets expressed through a dynamic graph. A DDP comprises events modelled as a multi-dimensional
  point process, with an intensity function parameterized by the edges of a dynamic
  weighted graph. The graph structure is modulated by a neural network that maps patient
  history to edge weights, enabling rich temporal representations for disease trajectories.
  The DDP parameters decouple into clinically meaningful components, which enables
  serving the dual purpose of accurate risk prediction and intelligible representation
  of disease pathology. We illustrate these features in experiments using cancer registry
  data.
