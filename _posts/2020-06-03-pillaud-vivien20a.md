title: Statistical Estimation of the Poincaré constant and Application to Sampling
  Multimodal Distributions
abstract: Poincaré inequalities are ubiquitous in probability and analysis and have
  various applications in statistics (concentration of measure, rate of convergence
  of Markov chains). The Poincaré constant, for which the inequality is tight, is
  related to the typical convergence rate of diffusions to their equilibrium measure.
  In this paper, we show both theoretically and experimentally that, given sufficiently
  many samples of a measure, we can estimate its Poincaré constant. As a by-product
  of the estimation of the Poincaré constant, we derive an algorithm that captures
  a low dimensional representation of the data by finding directions which are difficult
  to sample. These directions are of crucial importance for sampling or in fields
  like molecular dynamics, where they are called reaction coordinates. Their knowledge
  can leverage, with a simple conditioning step, computational bottlenecks by using
  importance sampling techniques.
