title: Explicit Mean-Square Error Bounds for Monte-Carlo and Linear Stochastic Approximation
abstract: 'This paper concerns error bounds for recursive equations subject to Markovian
  disturbances.   Motivating examples abound within the fields of Markov chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL),   and many of these algorithms can
  be interpreted as special cases of stochastic approximation (SA).   It is argued
  that it is not possible in general to obtain a Hoeffding bound on the error sequence,
  even when the underlying Markov chain is reversible and geometrically ergodic, such
  as the M/M/1 queue.  This is motivation for the focus on mean square error bounds
  for parameter estimates.  It is shown that  mean square error achieves the optimal
  rate of $O(1/n)$, subject to conditions on the step-size sequence.    Moreover,
  the exact constants in the rate are obtained,   which is of great value in algorithm
  design.   '
