title: Learning Dynamic Hierarchical Topic Graph with Graph Convolutional Network
  for Document Classification
abstract: Constructing a graph with graph convolutional network (GCN)  to explore
  the relational structure of the data has attracted lots of interests in various
  tasks. However, for document classification, existing graph based methods often
  focus on the straightforward word-word and word-document relations, ignoring the
  hierarchical semantics. Besides, the graph construction is often independent from
  the task-specific GCN learning. To address these constrains, we integrate a probabilistic
  deep topic model into graph construction, and propose a novel trainable hierarchical
  topic graph (HTG), including word-level, hierarchical topic-level and document-level
  nodes, exhibiting semantic variation from fine-grained to coarse. Regarding the
  document classification as a document-node label generation task, HTG can be dynamically
  evolved with GCN by performing variational inference, which leads to an end-to-end
  document classification method, named dynamic HTG (DHTG). Besides achieving state-of-the-art
  classification results, our model learns an interpretable document graph with meaningful
  node embeddings and semantic edges.
