title: A Diversity-aware Model for Majority Vote Ensemble Accuracy
abstract: Ensemble classifiers are a successful and popular approach for classification,
  and are frequently found to have better generalization performance than single models
  in practice. Although it is widely recognized that ‘diversity’ between ensemble
  members is important in achieving these performance gains, for classification ensembles
  it is not widely understood which diversity measures are most predictive of ensemble
  performance, nor how large an ensemble should be for a particular application. In
  this paper, we explore the predictive power of several common diversity measures
  and show – with extensive experiments – that contrary to earlier work that finds
  no clear link between these diversity measures (in isolation) and ensemble accuracy
  instead by using the $\rho$ diversity measure of Sneath and Sokal as an estimator
  for the dispersion parameter of a Polya-Eggenberger distribution we can predict,
  independently of the choice of base classifier family, the accuracy of a majority
  vote classifier ensemble ridiculously well. We discuss our model and some implications
  of our findings – such as diversity-aware (non-greedy) pruning of a majority-voting
  ensemble.
