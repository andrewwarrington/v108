title: Fairness Evaluation in Presence of Biased Noisy Labels
abstract: 'Risk assessment tools are widely used around the country to inform decision
  making within the criminal justice system. Recently, considerable attention has
  been devoted to the question of whether such tools may suffer from racial bias.
  In this type of assessment, a fundamental issue is that the training and evaluation
  of the model is based on a variable (arrest) that may represent a noisy version
  of an unobserved outcome of more central interest (offense). We propose a sensitivity
  analysis framework for assessing how assumptions on the noise across groups affect
  the predictive bias properties of the risk assessment model as a predictor of reoffense.
  Our experimental results on two real world criminal justice data sets demonstrate
  how even small biases in the observed labels may call into question the conclusions
  of an analysis based on the noisy outcome. '
