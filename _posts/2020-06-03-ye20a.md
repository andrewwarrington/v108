title: Optimization of Graph Total Variation via Active-Set-based Combinatorial Reconditioning
abstract: Structured convex optimization on weighted graphs finds numerous applications
  in machine learning and computer vision. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive
  preconditioning strategy for proximal algorithms on this problem class. Our preconditioner
  is driven by a sharp analysis of the local linear convergence rate depending on
  the "active set" at the current iterate. We show that nested-forest decomposition
  of the inactive edges yields a guaranteed local linear convergence rate. Further,
  we propose a practical greedy heuristic which realizes such nested decompositions
  and show in several numerical experiments that our reconditioning strategy, when
  applied to proximal gradient or primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm, achieves
  competitive performances. Our results suggest that local convergence analysis can
  serve as a guideline for selecting variable metrics in proximal algorithms.
