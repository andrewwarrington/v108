title: On Minimax Optimality of GANs for Robust Mean Estimation
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become one of the most popular
  generative modeling techniques in machine learning. In this work, we study the statistical
  and robust properties of GANs for Gaussian mean estimation under Huberâ€™s contamination
  model, where an epsilon proportion of training data may be arbitrarily corrupted.
  We prove that f-GAN, when equipped with appropriate discriminators, achieve optimal
  minimax rate, hence extending the recent result of Gao et al. (2019a). In contrast,
  we show that other GAN variants such as MMD-GAN (with Gaussian kernel) and W-GAN
  may fail to achieve minimax optimality. We further adapt f-GAN to the sparse and
  the unknown covariance settings. We perform numerical simulations to confirm our
  theoretical findings and reveal new insights on the importance of discriminators.
