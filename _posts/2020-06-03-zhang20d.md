title: Stochastic Particle-Optimization Sampling and the Non-Asymptotic Convergence
  Theory
abstract: Particle-optimization-based sampling (POS) is a recently developed effective
  sampling technique that interactively updates a set of particles. A representative
  algorithm is the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). We prove,  under certain
  conditions, SVGD experiences a theoretical pitfall, {\it i.e.}, particles tend to
  collapse. As a remedy, we generalize POS to a stochastic setting by injecting random
  noise into particle updates, thus termed stochastic particle-optimization sampling
  (SPOS). Notably, for the first time, we develop non-asymptotic convergence theory
  for the SPOS framework (related to SVGD), characterizing algorithm convergence in
  terms of the 1-Wasserstein distance w.r.t. the numbers of particles and iterations.
  Somewhat surprisingly, with the same number of updates (not too large) for each
  particle, our theory suggests adopting more particles does not necessarily lead
  to a better approximation of a target distribution, due to limited computational
  budget and numerical errors. This phenomenon is also observed in SVGD and verified
  via a synthetic experiment. Extensive experimental results verify our theory and
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
