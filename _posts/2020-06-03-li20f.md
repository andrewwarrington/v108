title: Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization in Networks with Gradient
  Tracking and Variance Reduction
abstract: Due to the imminent need to alleviate the communication burden in multi-agent
  and federated learning, the investigation of communication-efficient distributed
  optimization algorithms for empirical risk minimization has flourished recently.
  A large fraction of existing algorithms are developed for the master/slave setting,
  relying on the presence of a central parameter server. This paper focuses on distributed
  optimization in the network setting (also known as the decentralized setting), where
  each agent is only allowed to aggregate information from its neighbors over a graph.
  By properly adjusting the global gradient estimate via a tracking term, we first
  develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method, called Network-DANE,  which
  generalizes the attractive DANE algorithm to decentralized networks. Our key algorithmic
  ideas can be applied, in a systematic manner, to obtain decentralized versions of
  other master/slave distributed algorithms. Notably, we develop Network-SVRG/SARAH,
  which employ stochastic variance reduction at each agent to accelerate local computations.
  We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and Network-SVRG for strongly convex
  losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic losses, which shed light on the impact of
  data homogeneity, network connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence.
  Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the appealing performance of our algorithms
  over competitive baselines, in terms of both communication and computation efficiency.
