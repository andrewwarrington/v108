title: 'Deep Active Learning: Unified and Principled Method for Query and Training'
abstract: In this paper, we are proposing a unified and principled method for both
  the querying and training processes in deep batch active learning. We are providing
  theoretical insights from the intuition of modeling the interactive procedure in
  active learning as distribution matching, by adopting the Wasserstein distance.
  As a consequence, we derived a new training loss from the theoretical analysis,
  which is decomposed into optimizing deep neural network parameters and batch query
  selection through alternative optimization. In addition, the loss for training a
  deep neural network is naturally formulated as a min-max optimization problem through
  leveraging the unlabeled data information. Moreover, the proposed principles also
  indicate an explicit uncertainty-diversity trade-off in the query batch selection.
  Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on different benchmarks, consistently showing
  better empirical performances and a better time-efficient query strategy compared
  to the baselines.
