title: 'Ivy: Instrumental Variable Synthesis for Causal Inference'
abstract: 'A popular way to estimate the causal effect of a variable x on y from observational
  data is to use an instrumental variable (IV): a third variable z that affects y
  only through x. The more strongly z is associated with x, the more reliable the
  estimate is, but such strong IVs are difficult to find. Instead, practitioners combine
  more commonly available IV candidates—which are not necessarily strong, or even
  valid, IVs—into a single "summary" that is plugged into causal effect estimators
  in place of an IV. In genetic epidemiology, such approaches are known as allele
  scores. Allele scores require strong assumptions—independence and validity of all
  IV candidates—for the resulting estimate to be reliable. To relax these assumptions,
  we propose Ivy, a new method to combine IV candidates that can handle correlated
  and invalid IV candidates in a robust manner. Theoretically, we characterize this
  robustness, its limits, and its impact on the resulting causal estimates. Empirically,
  Ivy can correctly identify the directionality of known relationships and is robust
  against false discovery (median effect size <= 0.025) on three real-world datasets
  with no causal effects, while allele scores return more biased estimates (median
  effect size  >= 0.118).'
