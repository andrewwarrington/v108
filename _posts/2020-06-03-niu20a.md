title: Permutation Invariant Graph Generation via Score-Based Generative Modeling
abstract: Learning generative models for graph-structured data is challenging because
  graphs are discrete, combinatorial, and the underlying data distribution is invariant
  to the ordering of nodes. However, most of the existing generative models for graphs
  are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to an undesirable bias
  in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose a permutation
  invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent framework of score-based
  generative modeling. In particular, we design a permutation equivariant, multi-channel
  graph neural network to model the gradient of the data distribution at the input
  graph (a.k.a., the score function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients
  implicitly defines a permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this
  graph neural network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin
  dynamics. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture
  in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our learning
  approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on benchmark datasets.
