title: Low-rank regularization and solution uniqueness in over-parameterized matrix
  sensing
abstract: We consider the question whether algorithmic choices in over-parameterized
  linear matrix factorization introduce implicit low-rank regularization.We focus
  on the noiseless matrix sensing scenario over low-rank positive semi-definite (PSD)
  matrices over the reals, with a sensing mechanism that satisfies restricted isometry
  properties.Surprisingly, it was recently argued that for recovery of PSD matrices,
  gradient descent over a squared, \textit{full-rank} factorized space introduces
  implicit low-rank regularization.Thus, a clever choice of the recovery algorithm
  avoids the need for explicit low-rank regularization.  In this contribution, we
  prove that in fact, under certain conditions, the PSD constraint by itself is sufficient
  to lead to a unique low-rank matrix recovery, without explicit or implicit regularization.Therefore,
  under these conditions, the set of PSD matrices that are consistent with the observed
  data, is a singleton, regardless of the algorithm used. Our numerical study indicates
  that this result is general and extends to cases beyond the those covered by the
  proof.
