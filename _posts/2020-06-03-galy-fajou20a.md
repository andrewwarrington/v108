title: Automated Augmented Conjugate Inference for Non-conjugate Gaussian Process
  Models
abstract: We propose automated augmented conjugate inference, a new inference method
  for non-conjugate Gaussian processes (GP) models.Our method automatically constructs
  an auxiliary variable augmentation that renders the GP model conditionally conjugate.
  Building on the conjugate structure of the augmented model, we develop two inference
  methods. First, a fast and scalable stochastic variational inference method that
  uses efficient block coordinate ascent updates, which are computed in closed form.
  Second, an asymptotically correct Gibbs sampler that is useful for small datasets.Our
  experiments show that our method is up two orders of magnitude faster and more robust
  than existing state-of-the-art black-box methods.
