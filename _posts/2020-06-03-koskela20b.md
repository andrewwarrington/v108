title: Computing Tight Differential Privacy Guarantees Using FFT
abstract: Differentially private (DP) machine learning has recently become popular.
  The privacy loss of DP algorithms is commonly reported using (e.d)-DP. In this paper,
  we propose a numerical accountant for evaluating the privacy loss for algorithms
  with continuous one dimensional output. This accountant can be applied to the subsampled
  multidimensional Gaussian mechanism which underlies the popular DP stochastic gradient
  descent. The proposed method is based on a numerical approximation of an integral
  formula which gives the exact (e.d)-values. The approximation is carried out by
  discretising the integral and by evaluating discrete convolutions using the fast
  Fourier transform algorithm. We give theoretical error bounds which show the convergence
  of the approximation and guarantee its accuracy to an arbitrary degree. We give
  both theoretical error bounds and numerical error estimates for the approximation.
  Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate significant
  improvements in bound tightness and/or computation time.
