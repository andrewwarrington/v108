title: Accelerated Bayesian Optimisation through Weight-Prior Tuning
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely-used method for optimizing expensive
  (to evaluate) problems.  At the core of most BO methods is the modeling of the objective
  function using a Gaussian Process (GP) whose covariance is selected from a set of
  standard covariance functions.  From a weight-space view, this models the objective
  as a linear function in a feature space implied by the given covariance $K$, with
  an arbitrary Gaussian weight prior ${\bf w} \sim ormdist ({\bf 0},{\bf I})$.  In
  many practical applications there is data available that has a similar (covariance)
  structure to the objective, but which, having different form, cannot be used directly
  in standard transfer learning.  In this paper we show how such auxiliary data may
  be used to construct a GP covariance corresponding to a more appropriate weight
  prior for the objective function.  Building on this, we show that we may accelerate
  BO by modeling the objective function using this (learned) weight prior, which we
  demonstrate on both test functions and a practical application to short-polymer
  fibre manufacture.
