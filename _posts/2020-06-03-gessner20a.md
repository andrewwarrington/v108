title: Integrals over Gaussians under Linear Domain Constraints
abstract: Integrals of linearly constrained multivariate Gaussian densities are a
  frequent problem in machine learning and statistics, arising in tasks like generalized
  linear models and Bayesian optimization. Yet they are notoriously hard to compute,
  and to further complicate matters, the numerical values of such integrals may be
  very small. We present an efficient black-box algorithm that exploits geometry for
  the estimation of integrals over a small, truncated Gaussian volume, and to simulate
  therefrom. Our algorithm uses the Holmes-Diaconis-Ross (HDR) method combined with
  an analytic version of elliptical slice sampling (ESS). Adapted to the linear setting,
  ESS allows for rejection-free sampling, because intersections of ellipses and domain
  boundaries have closed-form solutions. The key idea of HDR is to decompose the integral
  into easier-to-compute conditional probabilities by using a sequence of nested domains.
  Remarkably, it allows for direct computation of the logarithm of the integral value
  and thus enables the computation of extremely small probability masses. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our tailored combination of HDR and ESS on high-dimensional
  integrals and on entropy search for Bayesian optimization.
