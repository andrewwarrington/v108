title: Validation of Approximate Likelihood and Emulator Models for Computationally
  Intensive Simulations
abstract: 'Complex phenomena in engineering and the sciences are often modeled with
  computationally intensive feed-forward simulations for which a tractable analytic
  likelihood does not exist. In these cases, it is sometimes necessary to estimate
  an approximate likelihood or fit a fast emulator model for efficient statistical
  inference; such surrogate models include Gaussian synthetic likelihoods and more
  recently neural density estimators such as autoregressive models and normalizing
  flows.  To date, however, there is no consistent way of quantifying the quality
  of such a fit. Here we propose a statistical framework that can distinguish any
  arbitrary misspecified model from the target likelihood, and that in addition can
  identify with statistical confidence the regions of parameter as well as feature
  space where the fit is inadequate.  At the heart of our approach is a  two-sample
  test that quantifies the quality of the fit at fixed parameter values, and a global
  test that assesses goodness-of-fit across simulation parameters. While our general
  framework can incorporate any test statistic or distance metric, we specifically
  argue for a new two-sample test that can leverage any regression method to attain
  high power and provide diagnostics in complex data settings. Software for our approach
  is available on GitHub in Python and R. '
