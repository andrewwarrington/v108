title: Understanding Generalization in Deep Learning via Tensor Methods
abstract: Deep neural networks generalize well on unseen data though the number of
  parameters often far exceeds the number of training examples. Recently proposed
  complexity measures have provided insights to understanding the generalizability
  in neural networks from perspectives of PAC-Bayes, robustness, overparametrization,
  compression and so on. In this work, we advance the understanding of the relations
  between the networkâ€™s architecture and its generalizability from the compression
  perspective. Using tensor analysis, we propose a series of intuitive, data-dependent
  and easily-measurable properties that tightly characterize the compressibility and
  generalizability of neural networks; thus, in practice, our generalization bound
  outperforms the previous compression-based ones, especially for neural networks
  using tensors as their weight kernels (e.g. CNNs). Moreover, these intuitive measurements
  provide further insights into designing neural network architectures with properties
  favorable for better/guaranteed generalizability. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that through the proposed measurable properties, our generalization error bound
  matches the trend of the test error well. Our theoretical analysis further provides
  justifications for the empirical success and limitations of some widely-used tensor-based
  compression approaches. We also discover the improvements to the compressibility
  and robustness of current neural networks when incorporating tensor operations via
  our proposed layer-wise structure.
