title: On the interplay between noise and curvature and its effect on optimization
  and generalization
abstract: " The speed at which one can minimize an expected loss using stochastic
  methods depends on two properties: the curvature of the loss and the variance of
  the gradients. While most previous works focus on one or the other of these properties,
  we explore how their interaction affects optimization speed. Further, as the ultimate
  goal is good generalization performance, we clarify how both curvature and noise
  are relevant to properly estimate the generalization gap. Realizing that the limitations
  of some existing works stems from a confusion between these matrices, we also clarify
  the distinction between the Fisher matrix, the Hessian, and the covariance matrix
  of the gradients."
