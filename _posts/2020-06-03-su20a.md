title: Multiplicative Gaussian Particle Filter
abstract: We propose a new sampling-based approach for approximate inference in filtering
  problems. Instead of approximating conditional distributions with a finite set of
  states, as done in particle filters, our approach approximates the distribution
  with a weighted sum of functions from a set of continuous functions. Central to
  the approach is the use of sampling to approximate multiplications in the Bayes
  filter. We provide theoretical analysis, giving conditions for sampling to give
  good approximation. We next specialize to the case of weighted sums of Gaussians,
  and show how properties of Gaussians enable closed-form transition and efficient
  multiplication. Lastly, we conduct preliminary experiments on a robot localization
  problem and compare performance with the particle filter, to demonstrate the potential
  of the proposed method.
