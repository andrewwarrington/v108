title: Adversarial Robustness of Flow-Based Generative Models
abstract: Flow-based generative models leverage invertible generator functions to
  fit a distribution to the training data using maximum likelihood. Despite their
  use in several application domains, robustness of these models to adversarial attacks
  has hardly been explored. In this paper, we study adversarial robustness of flow-based
  generative models both theoretically (for some simple models) and empirically (for
  more complex ones). First, we consider a linear flow-based generative model and
  compute optimal sample-specific and universal adversarial perturbations that maximally
  decrease the likelihood scores. Using this result, we study the robustness of the
  well-known adversarial training procedure, where we characterize the fundamental
  trade-off between model robustness and accuracy. Next, we empirically study the
  robustness of two prominent deep, non-linear, flow-based generative models, namely
  GLOW and RealNVP. We design two types of adversarial attacks; one that minimizes
  the likelihood scores of in-distribution samples, while the other that maximizes
  the likelihood scores of out-of-distribution ones. We find that GLOW and RealNVP
  are extremely sensitive to both types of attacks. Finally, using a hybrid adversarial
  training procedure, we significantly boost the robustness of these generative models.
