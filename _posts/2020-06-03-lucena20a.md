title: Exploiting Categorical Structure Using Tree-Based Methods
abstract: Standard methods of using categorical variables as predictors either endow
  them with an ordinal structure or assume they have no structure at all.  However,
  categorical variables often possess structure that is more complicated than a linear
  ordering can capture. We develop a mathematical framework for representing the structure
  of categorical variables and show how to generalize decision trees to make use of
  this structure.  This approach is applicable to methods such as Gradient Boosted
  Trees which use a decision tree as the underlying learner.  We show results on weather
  data to demonstrate the improvement yielded by this approach.
