title: 'Gain with no Pain: Efficiency of Kernel-PCA by Nyström Sampling'
abstract: " In this paper, we analyze a Nyström based approach to efficient large
  scale kernel principal component analysis  (PCA). The latter is a natural nonlinear
  extension of classical PCA based on considering a nonlinear feature map or the  corresponding
  kernel. Like other kernel approaches, kernel PCA enjoys good mathematical and statistical
  properties but, numerically, it scales poorly with the sample size. Our analysis
  shows that Nyström sampling greatly improves computational efficiency without incurring
  any loss of statistical accuracy. While similar effects have been observed in supervised
  learning, this is the first such result for PCA. Our theoretical findings are based
  on a combination of analytic and concentration of measure techniques. Our study
  is more broadly motivated by the question of understanding the  interplay  between
  statistical and computational requirements for learning."
