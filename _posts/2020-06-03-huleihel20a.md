title: Sharp Thresholds of the Information Cascade Fragility Under a Mismatched Model
abstract: 'We analyze a sequential decision making model in which decision makers
  (or, players) take their decisions based on their own private information as well
  as the actions of previous decision makers. Such decision making processes often
  lead to what is known as the \emph{information cascade} or \emph{herding} phenomenon.
  Specifically, a cascade develops when it seems rational for some players to abandon
  their own private information and imitate the actions of earlier players. The risk,
  however, is that if the initial decisions were wrong, then the whole cascade will
  be wrong. Nonetheless, information cascade are known to be fragile: there exists
  a sequence of \emph{revealing} probabilities $\{p_{\ell}\}_{\ell\geq1}$, such that
  if with probability $p_{\ell}$ player $\ell$ ignores the decisions of previous players,
  and rely on his private information only, then wrong cascades can be avoided. Previous
  related papers which study the fragility of information cascades always assume that
  the revealing probabilities are known to all players perfectly, which might be unrealistic
  in practice. Accordingly, in this paper we study a mismatch model where players
  believe that the revealing probabilities are $\{q_\ell\}_{\ell\in\mathbb{N}}$ when
  they truly are $\{p_\ell\}_{\ell\in\mathbb{N}}$, and study the effect of this mismatch
  on information cascades. We consider both adversarial and probabilistic sequential
  decision making models, and derive closed-form expressions for the optimal learning
  rates at which the error probability associated with a certain decision maker goes
  to zero. We prove several novel phase transitions in the behaviour of the asymptotic
  learning rate.'
