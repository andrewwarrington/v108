title: Dynamic content based ranking
abstract: We introduce a novel state space model for a set of sequentially time-stamped
  partial rankings of items and textual descriptions for the items. Based on the data,
  the model infers text-based themes that are predictive of the rankings enabling
  forecasting tasks and performing trend analysis. We propose a scaled Gamma process
  based prior for capturing the underlying dynamics. Based on two challenging and
  contemporary real data collections, we show the model infers meaningful and useful
  textual themes as well as performs better than existing related dynamic models.
