title: Understanding the Effects of Batching in Online Active Learning
abstract: 'Online active learning (AL) algorithms often assume immediate access to
  a label once a query has been made. However, due to practical constraints, the labels
  of these queried examples are generally only available in “batches”.  In this work,
  we present an analysis for a generic class of batch online AL algorithms, which
  reveals that the effects of batching are in fact mild and only result in an additional
  label complexity term that is quasilinear in the batch size. To our knowledge, this
  provides the first theoretical justification for such algorithms and we show how
  they can be applied to batch variants of three canonical online AL algorithms: IWAL,
  ORIWAL, and DHM. Finally, we also present empirical results across several benchmark
  datasets that corroborate these theoretical insights.'
