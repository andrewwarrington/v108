title: 'PersLay: A Neural Network Layer for Persistence Diagrams and New Graph Topological
  Signatures'
abstract: Persistence diagrams, the most common descriptors of Topological Data Analysis,
  encode topological properties of data and have already proved pivotal in many different
  applications of data science. However, since the metric space of persistence diagrams
  is not Hilbert, they end up being difficult inputs for most Machine Learning techniques.
  To address this concern, several vectorization methods have been put forward that
  embed persistence diagrams into either finite-dimensional Euclidean space or implicit
  infinite dimensional Hilbert space with kernels. In this work, we focus on persistence
  diagrams built on top of graphs. Relying on extended persistence theory and the
  so-called heat kernel signature, we show how graphs can be encoded by (extended)
  persistence diagrams in a provably stable way. We then propose a general and versatile
  framework for learning vectorizations of persistence diagrams, which encompasses
  most of the vectorization techniques used in the literature. We finally showcase
  the experimental strength of our setup by achieving competitive scores on classification
  tasks on real-life graph datasets.
