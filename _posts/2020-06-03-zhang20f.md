title: Stepwise Model Selection for Sequence Prediction via Deep Kernel Learning
abstract: An essential problem in automated machine learning (AutoML) is that of model
  selection. A unique challenge in the sequential setting is the fact that the optimal
  model itself may vary over time, depending on the distribution of features and labels
  available up to each point in time. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization
  (BO) algorithm to tackle the challenge of model selection in this setting. This
  is accomplished by treating the performance at each time step as its own black-box
  function. In order to solve the resulting multiple black-box function optimization
  problem jointly and efficiently, we exploit potential correlations among black-box
  functions using deep kernel learning (DKL). To the best of our knowledge, we are
  the first to formulate the problem of stepwise model selection (SMS) for sequence
  prediction, and to design and demonstrate an efficient joint-learning algorithm
  for this purpose. Using multiple real-world datasets, we verify that our proposed
  method outperforms both standard BO and multi-objective BO algorithms on a variety
  of sequence prediction tasks.
