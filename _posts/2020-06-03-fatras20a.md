title: 'Learning with minibatch Wasserstein  : asymptotic and gradient properties'
abstract: Optimal transport distances are powerful tools to compare probability distributions
  and have found many applications in machine learning. Yet their algorithmic complexity
  prevents their direct use on large scale datasets. To overcome this challenge, practitioners
  compute these distances on minibatches i.e., they average the outcome of several
  smaller optimal transport problems. We propose in this paper an analysis of this
  practice, which effects are not well understood so far. We notably argue that it
  is equivalent to an implicit regularization of the original problem, with appealing
  properties such as unbiased estimators, gradients and a concentration bound around
  the expectation, but also with defects such as loss of distance property. Along
  with this theoretical analysis, we also conduct empirical experiments on gradient
  flows, GANs or color transfer that highlight the practical interest of this strategy.
