title: A Linear-time Independence Criterion Based on a Finite Basis Approximation
abstract: Detection of statistical dependence between random variables is an essential
  component in many machine learning algorithms. We propose a novel independence criterion
  for two random variables with linear-time complexity. We establish that our independence
  criterion is an upper bound of the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-RÃ©nyi maximum correlation
  coefficient between tested variables. A finite set of basis functions is employed
  to approximate the mapping functions that can achieve the maximal correlation. Using
  classic benchmark experiments based on independent component analysis, we demonstrate
  that our independence criterion performs comparably with the state-of-the-art quadratic-time
  kernel dependence measures like the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion, while
  being more efficient in computation. The experimental results also show that our
  independence criterion outperforms another contemporary linear-time kernel dependence
  measure, the Finite Set Independence Criterion. The potential application of our
  criterion in deep neural networks is validated experimentally.
