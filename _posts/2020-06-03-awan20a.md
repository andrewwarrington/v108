title: Almost-Matching-Exactly for Treatment Effect Estimation under Network Interference
abstract: We propose a matching method that recovers direct treatment effects from
  randomized experiments where units are connected in an observed network, and units
  that share edges can potentially influence each othersâ€™ outcomes. Traditional treatment
  effect estimators for randomized experiments are biased and error prone in this
  setting. Our method matches units almost exactly on counts of unique subgraphs within
  their neighborhood graphs. The matches that we construct are interpretable and high-quality.
  Our method can be extended easily to accommodate additional unit-level covariate
  information. We show empirically that our method performs better than other existing
  methodologies for this problem, while producing meaningful, interpretable results.
