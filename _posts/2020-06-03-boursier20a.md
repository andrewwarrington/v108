title: Utility/Privacy Trade-off through the lens of Optimal Transport
abstract: Strategic information is valuable either by remaining private (for instance
  if it is sensitive) or, on the other hand, by being used publicly to increase some
  utility. These two objectives are antagonistic and leaking this information might
  be more rewarding than concealing it. Unlike classical solutions that focus on the
  first point, we consider instead agents that optimize a natural trade-off between
  both  objectives.We formalize this as an optimization problem where the objective
  mapping is regularized by the amount of information revealed to the adversary (measured
  as a divergence between the prior and posterior on the private knowledge). Quite
  surprisingly, when combined with the entropic regularization, the Sinkhorn loss
  naturally emerges in the optimization objective, making it efficiently solvable.
  We apply these techniques to preserve some privacy in online repeated auctions.
