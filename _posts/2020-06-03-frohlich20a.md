title: Noisy-Input Entropy Search for Efficient Robust Bayesian Optimization
abstract: We consider the problem of robust optimization within the well-established
  Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework.While BO is intrinsically robust to noisy evaluations
  of the objective function, standard approaches do not consider the case of uncertainty
  about the input parameters.In this paper, we propose Noisy-Input Entropy Search
  (NES), a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that is designed to find
  robust optima for problems with both input and measurement noise.NES is based on
  the key insight that the robust objective in many cases can be modeled as a Gaussian
  process, however, it cannot be observed directly.We evaluate NES on several benchmark
  problems from the optimization literature and from engineering.The results show
  that NES reliably finds robust optima, outperforming existing methods from the literature
  on all benchmarks.
