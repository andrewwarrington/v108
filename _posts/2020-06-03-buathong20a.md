title: Kernels over Sets of Finite Sets using RKHS Embeddings, with Application to
  Bayesian (Combinatorial) Optimization
abstract: 'We focus on kernel methods for set-valued inputs and their application
  to Bayesian set optimization, notably combinatorial optimization. We investigate
  two classes of set kernels that both rely on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space embeddings,
  namely the "Double Sum" (DS) kernels recently considered in Bayesian set optimization,
  and a class introduced here called "Deep Embedding" (DE) kernels that essentially
  consists in applying a radial kernel on Hilbert space on top of the canonical distance
  induced by another kernel such as a DS kernel. We establish in particular that while
  DS kernels typically suffer from a lack of strict positive definiteness, vast subclasses
  of DE kernels built upon DS kernels do possess this property, enabling in turn combinatorial
  optimization without requiring to introduce a jitter parameter.  Proofs of theoretical
  results about considered kernels are complemented by a few practicalities regarding
  hyperparameter fitting. We furthermore demonstrate the applicability of our approach
  in prediction and optimization tasks, relying both on toy examples and on two test
  cases from mechanical engineering and hydrogeology, respectively. Experimental results
  highlight the applicability and compared merits of the considered approaches while
  opening new perspectives in prediction and sequential design with set inputs.   '
