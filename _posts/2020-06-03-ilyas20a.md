title: A Theoretical and Practical Framework for Regression and Classification from
  Truncated Samples
abstract: Machine learning and statistics are invaluable for extracting insights from
  data. A key assumption of most methods, however, is that they have access to independent
  samples from the distribution of relevant data. As such, these methods often perform
  poorly in the face of {\em biased data} which breaks this assumption. In this work,
  we consider the classical challenge of bias due to truncation, wherein samples falling
  outside of an “observation window” cannot be observed. We present a general framework
  for regression and classification from  samples that are truncated according to
  the value of the dependent variable. The framework argues that stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) can be efficiently executed on the population log-likelihood of the
  truncated sample. Our framework is  broadly applicable, and we provide end-to-end
  guarantees for the well-studied problems of truncated logistic and probit regression,
  where we argue that the true model parameters can be identified computationally
  and statistically efficiently from truncated data, extending recent work on truncated
  linear regression. We also provide experiments to illustrate the practicality of
  our framework on synthetic and real data.
