title: An Inverse-free Truncated Rayleigh-Ritz Method for Sparse Generalized Eigenvalue
  Problem
abstract: This paper considers the sparse generalized eigenvalue problem (SGEP), which
  aims to find the leading eigenvector with at most $k$ nonzero entries. SGEP naturally
  arises in many applications in machine learning, statistics, and scientific computing,
  for example, the sparse principal component analysis (SPCA), the sparse discriminant
  analysis (SDA), and the sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA). In this paper,
  we focus on the development of a three-stage algorithm named {\em inverse-free truncated
  Rayleigh-Ritz method} ({\em IFTRR})  to efficiently solve  SGEP. In each iteration
  of IFTRR, only a small number of matrix-vector products is required. This makes
  IFTRR well-suited for large scale problems. Particularly, a new truncation strategy
  is proposed, which is able to find the support set of the leading eigenvector effectively.
  Theoretical results are developed to explain why IFTRR works well. Numerical simulations
  demonstrate the merits of IFTRR.
