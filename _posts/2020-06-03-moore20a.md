title: 'The Quantile Snapshot Scan: Comparing Quantiles of Spatial Data from Two Snapshots
  in Time'
abstract: 'We introduce the Quantile Snapshot Scan (Qsnap), a spatial scan algorithm
  which identifies spatial regions that differ the most between two snapshots in time.
  Qsnap is designed for spatial data with a numeric response and a vector of associated
  covariates for each spatial data point. Qsnap focuses on differences involving a
  specific quantile of the data distribution. A naive implementation of Qsnap is too
  computationally expensive for large datasets but our novel incremental update provides
  an order of magnitude speedup. We demonstrate Qsnapâ€™s effectiveness over an extensive
  set of experiments on simulated data. In addition, we apply Qsnap to two real-world
  problems: discovering bird migration paths and identifying regions with dramatic
  changes in drought conditions.'
