title: Fair Correlation Clustering
abstract: In this paper, we study correlation clustering under fairness constraints.  Fair
  variants of $k$-median and $k$-center clustering have been studied recently, and
  approximation algorithms using a notion called fairlet decomposition have been proposed.  We
  obtain approximation algorithms for fair correlation clustering under several important
  types of fairness constraints.Our results hinge on obtaining a fairlet decomposition
  for correlation clustering by introducing a novel combinatorial optimization problem.  We
  define a fairlet decomposition with cost similar to the $k$-median cost and this
  allows us to obtain approximation algorithms for a wide range of fairness constraints.
  We complement our theoretical results with an in-depth analysis of our algorithms
  on real graphs where we show that fair solutions to correlation clustering can be
  obtained with limited increase in cost compared to the state-of-the-art (unfair)
  algorithms.
