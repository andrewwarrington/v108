title: Derivative-Free & Order-Robust Optimisation
abstract: "\tIn this paper, we formalise order-robust optimisation as an instance
  of online learning minimising simple regret, and propose Vroom, a zeroâ€™th order
  optimisation algorithm capable of achieving vanishing regret in non-stationary environments,
  while recovering favorable rates under stochastic reward-generating processes. Our
  results are the first to target simple regret definitions in adversarial scenarios
  unveiling a challenge that has been rarely considered in prior work."
