title: 'GP-VAE: Deep Probabilistic Time Series Imputation'
abstract: 'Multivariate time series with missing values are common in areas such as
  healthcare and finance, and have grown in number and complexity over the years.
  This raises the question whether deep learning methodologies can outperform classical
  data imputation methods in this domain. However, naive applications of deep learning
  fall short in giving reliable confidence estimates and lack interpretability.We
  propose a new deep sequential latent variable model for dimensionality reduction
  and data imputation. Our modeling assumption is simple and interpretable: the high
  dimensional time series has a lower-dimensional representation which evolves smoothly
  in time according to a Gaussian process. The non-linear dimensionality reduction
  in the presence of missing data is achieved using a VAE approach with a novel structured
  variational approximation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms both classical
  and recent deep learning-based data imputation methods on high dimensional data
  from the domains of computer vision and healthcare.'
