title: 'Uncertainty in Neural Networks: Approximately Bayesian Ensembling'
abstract: Understanding the uncertainty of a neural networkâ€™s (NN) predictions is
  essential for many purposes. The Bayesian framework provides a principled approach
  to this, however applying it to NNs is challenging due to large numbers of parameters
  and data. Ensembling NNs provides an easily implementable, scalable method for uncertainty
  quantification, however, it has been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work
  proposes one modification to the usual process that we argue does result in approximate
  Bayesian inference; regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution
  which can be set equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in
  a simplified setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends
  to have an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However,
  two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are partially
  present in NNs.  Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage over standard
  ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.
