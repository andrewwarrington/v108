title: Calibrated Surrogate Maximization of Linear-fractional Utility in Binary Classification
abstract: "  Complex classification performance metrics such as the F-measure and
  Jaccard index are often used,  in order to handle class-imbalanced cases such as
  information retrieval and image segmentation.  These performance metrics are not
  decomposable, that is, they cannot be expressed in a per-example manner,  which
  hinders a straightforward application of M-estimation widely used in supervised
  learning.  In this paper, we consider linear-fractional metrics, which are a family
  of classification performance metrics that encompasses many standard ones such as
  the F-measure and Jaccard index,  and propose methods to directly maximize performances
  under those metrics.  A clue to tackle their direct optimization is a calibrated
  surrogate utility,  which is a tractable lower bound of the true utility function
  representing a given metric.  We characterize sufficient conditions which make the
  surrogate maximization coincide with the maximization of the true utility.  Simulation
  results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our calibrated surrogate
  maximization  especially if the sample sizes are extremely small."
