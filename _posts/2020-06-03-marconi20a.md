title: Hyperbolic Manifold Regression
abstract: 'Geometric representation learning has shown great promise for important
  tasks inartificial intelligence and machine learning. However, an open problem is
  yethow to integrate non-Euclidean representations with standard machine learningmethods.In
  this work, we consider the task of regression onto hyperbolic space for whichwe
  propose two approaches: a non-parametric kernel-method for which we also proveexcess
  risk bounds and a parametric deep learning model that is informed bythe geodesics
  of the target space.By recasting predictions on trees as manifold regression problems
  we demonstrate the applications of our approach on two challenging tasks: 1)hierarchical
  classification via label embeddings and 2) inventing new conceptsby predicting their
  embedding in a continuous representation of a base taxonomy.In our experiments,
  we find that the proposed estimators outperform their naivecounterparts that perform
  regression in the ambient Euclidean space.'
