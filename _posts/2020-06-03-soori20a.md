title: 'DAve-QN: A Distributed Averaged Quasi-Newton Method with Local Superlinear
  Convergence Rate'
abstract: In this paper, we consider distributed algorithms for solving the empirical
  risk minimization problem under the master/worker communication model. We develop
  a distributed asynchronous quasi-Newton algorithm that can achieve superlinear convergence.
  To our knowledge, this is the first distributed asynchronous algorithm with superlinear
  convergence guarantees. Our algorithm is communication-efficient in the sense that
  at every iteration the master node and workers communicate vectors of size $O(p)$,
  where $p$ is the dimension of the decision variable.  The proposed method is based
  on a distributed asynchronous averaging scheme of decision vectors and gradients
  in a way to effectively capture the local Hessian information of the objective function.
  Our convergence theory supports asynchronous computations subject to both bounded
  delays and unbounded delays with a bounded time-average. Unlike in the majority
  of asynchronous optimization literature, we do not require choosing smaller stepsize
  when delays are huge. We provide numerical experiments that match our theoretical
  results and showcase significant improvement comparing to state-of-the-art distributed
  algorithms.
