title: Sample complexity bounds for localized sketching
abstract: " We consider sketched approximate matrix multiplication and ridge regression
  in the novel setting of localized sketching, where at any given point, only part
  of the data matrix is available. This corresponds to a block diagonal structure
  on the sketching matrix. We show that, under mild conditions, block diagonal sketching
  matrices require only $O(\\sr / \\epsilon^2)$ and $O(\\sd_{\\lambda}/\\epsilon)$
  total sample complexity for matrix multiplication and ridge regression, respectively.
  This matches the state-of-the-art bounds that are obtained using global sketching
  matrices. The localized nature of sketching considered allows for different parts
  of the data matrix to be sketched independently and hence is more amenable to computation
  in distributed and streaming settings and results in a smaller memory and computational
  footprint."
