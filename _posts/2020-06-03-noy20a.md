title: 'ASAP: Architecture Search, Anneal and Prune'
abstract: Automatic methods for Neural ArchitectureSearch (NAS) have been shown to
  produce state-of-the-art network models, yet, their main drawback is the computational
  complexity of the search process. As some primal methods optimized over a discrete
  search space, thousands of days of GPU were required for convergence. A recent approach
  is based on constructing a differentiable search space that enables gradient-based
  optimization, thus reducing the search time to a few days. While successful, such
  methods still include some incontinuous steps, e.g., the pruning of many weak connections
  at once. In this paper, we propose a differentiable search space that allows the
  annealing of architecture weights, while gradually pruning inferior operations,
  thus the search converges to a single output network in a continuous manner. Experiments
  on several vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect
  to the search cost, accuracy and the memory footprint of the achieved model.
