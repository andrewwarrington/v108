title: Scalable Feature Selection for (Multitask) Gradient Boosted Trees
abstract: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) are widely used for building ranking
  and relevance models in search and recommendation. Considerations such as latency
  and interpretability dictate the use of as few features as possible to train these
  models. Feature selection in GBDT models typically involves heuristically ranking
  the features by importance and selecting the top few, or by per- forming a full
  backward feature elimination routine. On-the-fly feature selection methods proposed
  previously scale suboptimally with the number of features, which can be daunt- ing
  in high dimensional settings. We develop a scalable forward feature selection variant
  for GBDT, via a novel group testing procedure that works well in high dimensions,
  and enjoys favorable theoretical performance and computational guarantees. We show
  via ex- tensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets that the proposed
  method offers significant speedups in training time, while being as competitive
  as existing GBDT methods in terms of model performance metrics. We also extend the
  method to the multitask setting, allowing the practitioner to select common features
  across tasks, as well as selecting task-specific features.
