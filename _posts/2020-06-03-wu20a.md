title: 'Graph DNA: Deep Neighborhood Aware Graph Encoding for Collaborative Filtering'
abstract: In this paper, we consider recommender systems with side information in
  the form of graphs. Existing collaborative filtering algorithms mainly utilize only
  immediate neighborhood information and do not efficiently take advantage of deeper
  neighborhoods beyond 1-2 hops. The main issue with exploiting deeper graph information
  is the rapidly growing time and space complexity when incorporating information
  from these neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose using Graph DNA, a novel Deep
  Neighborhood Aware graph encoding algorithm, for exploiting multi-hop neighborhood
  information. DNA encoding computes approximate deep neighborhood information in
  linear time using Bloom filters, and results in a per-node encoding whose dimension
  is logarithmic in the number of nodes in the graph. It can be used in conjunction
  with both feature-based and graph-regularization-based collaborative filtering algorithms.  Graph
  DNA has the advantages of being memory and time efficient and providing additional
  regularization when compared to directly using higher order graph information. We
  provide theoretical performance bounds for graph DNA encoding, and experimentally
  show that graph DNA can be used with 4 popular collaborative filtering algorithms
  to consistently boost their performances with little computational and memory overhead.
