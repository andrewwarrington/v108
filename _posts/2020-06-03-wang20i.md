title: 'Causal inference in degenerate systems: An impossibility result'
abstract: Causal relationships among variables are commonly represented via directed
  acyclic graphs. There are many methods in the literature to quantify the strength
  of arrows in a causal acyclic graph. These methods, however, have undesirable properties
  when the causal system represented by a directed acyclic graph is degenerate. In
  this paper, we characterize a degenerate causal system using multiplicity of Markov
  boundaries. We show that in this case, it is impossible to find an identifiable
  quantitative measure of causal effects that satisfy a set of natural criteria. To
  supplement the impossibility result, we also develop algorithms to identify degenerate
  causal systems from observed data. Performance of our algorithms is investigated
  through synthetic data analysis.
