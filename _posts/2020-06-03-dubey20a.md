title: Distributed, partially collapsed MCMC for Bayesian Nonparametrics
abstract: 'Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models provide elegant methods for discovering
  underlying latent features within a data set, but inference in such models can be
  slow. We exploit the fact that completely random measures, which commonly-used models
  like the Dirichlet process and the beta-Bernoulli process can be expressed using,
  are decomposable into independent sub-measures.   We use this decomposition to partition
  the latent measure into a finite measure containing only instantiated components,
  and an infinite measure containing all other components. We then select different
  inference algorithms for the two components: uncollapsed samplers mix well on the
  finite measure, while collapsed samplers mix well on the infinite, sparsely occupied
  tail. The resulting hybrid algorithm can be applied to a wide class of models, and
  can be easily distributed to allow scalable inference without sacrificing asymptotic
  convergence guarantees. '
