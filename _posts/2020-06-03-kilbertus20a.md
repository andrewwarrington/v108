title: Fair Decisions Despite Imperfect Predictions
abstract: Consequential decisions are increasingly informed by sophisticated data-driven
  predictive models. However, consistently learning accurate predictive models requires
  access to ground truth labels. Unfortunately, in practice, labels may only exist
  conditional on certain decisions—if a loan is denied, there is not even an option
  for the individual to pay back the loan. In this paper, we show that, in this selective
  labels setting, learning to predict is suboptimal in terms of both fairness and
  utility. To avoid this undesirable behavior, we propose to directly learn stochastic
  decision policies that maximize utility under fairness constraints. In the context
  of fair machine learning, our results suggest the need for a paradigm shift from
  "learning to predict" to "learning to decide". Experiments on synthetic and real-world
  data illustrate the favorable properties of learning to decide, in terms of both
  utility and fairness.
