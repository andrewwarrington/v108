title: Data Generation for Neural Programming by Example
abstract: Programming by example is the problem of synthesizing a program from a small
  set of input / output pairs. Recent works applying machine learning methods to this
  task show promise, but are typically reliant on generating synthetic examples for
  training. A particular challenge lies in generating meaningful sets of inputs and
  outputs, which well-characterize a given program and accurately demonstrate its
  behavior. Where examples used for testing are generated by the same method as training
  data then the performance of a model may be partly reliant on this similarity. In
  this paper we introduce a novel approach using an SMT solver to synthesize inputs
  which cover a diverse set of behaviors for a given program. We carry out a case
  study comparing this method to existing synthetic data generation procedures in
  the literature, and find that data generated using our approach improves both the
  discriminatory power of example sets and the ability of trained machine learning
  models to generalize to unfamiliar data.
