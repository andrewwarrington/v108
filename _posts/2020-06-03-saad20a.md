title: 'The Fast Loaded Dice Roller: A Near-Optimal Exact Sampler for Discrete Probability
  Distributions'
abstract: 'This paper introduces a new algorithm for the fundamental problem of generating
  a random integer from a discrete probability distribution using a source of independent
  and unbiased random coin flips.  We prove that this algorithm, which we call the
  Fast Loaded Dice Roller (FLDR), is highly efficient in both space and time: (i)
  the size of the sampler is guaranteed to be linear in the number of bits needed
  to encode the input distribution; and (ii) the expected number of bits of entropy
  it consumes per sample is at most 6 bits more than the information-theoretically
  optimal rate.  We present fast implementations of the linear-time preprocessing
  and near-optimal sampling algorithms using unsigned integer arithmetic.  Empirical
  evaluations on a broad set of probability distributions establish that FLDR is 2x-10x
  faster in both preprocessing and sampling than multiple baseline algorithms, including
  the widely-used alias and interval samplers.  It also uses up to 10000x less space
  than the information-theoretically optimal sampler, at the expense of less than
  1.5x runtime overhead.'
