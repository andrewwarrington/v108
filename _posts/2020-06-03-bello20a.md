title: Minimax Bounds for Structured Prediction Based on Factor Graphs
abstract: Structured prediction can be considered as a generalization of many standard
  supervised learning tasks, and is usually thought as a simultaneous prediction of
  multiple labels. One standard approach is to maximize a score function on the space
  of labels, which usually decomposes as a sum of unary and pairwise potentials, each
  depending on one or two specific labels, respectively.For this approach, several
  learning and inference algorithms have been proposed over the years, ranging from
  exact to approximate methods while balancing the computational complexity.However,
  in contrast to binary and multiclass classification, results on the necessary number
  of samples for achieving learning are still limited, even for a specific family
  of predictors such as factor graphs.In this work, we provide minimax lower bounds
  for a class of general factor-graph inference models in the context of structured
  prediction.That is, we characterize the necessary sample complexity for any conceivable
  algorithm to achieve learning of general factor-graph predictors.
