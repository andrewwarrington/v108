title: 'OSOM: A simultaneously optimal algorithm for multi-armed and linear contextual
  bandits'
abstract: We consider the stochastic linear (multi-armed) contextual bandit problem
  with the possibility of hidden simple multi-armed bandit structure in which the
  rewards are independent of the contextual information. Algorithms that are designed
  solely for one of the regimes are known to be sub-optimal for their alternate regime.
  We design a single computationally efficient algorithm that simultaneously obtains
  problem-dependent optimal regret rates in the simple multi-armed bandit regime and
  minimax optimal regret rates in the linear contextual bandit regime, without knowing
  a priori which of the two models generates the rewards. These results are proved
  under the condition of stochasticity of contextual information over multiple rounds.
  Our results should be viewed as a step towards principled data-dependent policy
  class selection for contextual bandits.
