title: Multi-level Gaussian Graphical Models Conditional on Covariates
abstract: We address the problem of learning the structure of a high-dimensional Gaussian
  graphical model conditional on covariates, when each sample belongs to groups at
  multiple levels of hierarchy. The existing statistical methods for learning covariate-conditioned
  Gaussian  graphical models focused on learning the aggregate behavior of inputs
  and outputs in a single-layer network. We propose a statistical model called multi-level
  conditional Gaussian graphical models for modeling multi-level output networks influenced
  by both individual-level and group-level inputs. We describe a decomposition of
  our model into a product of two components, one for sum variables and the other
  for difference variables derived from the original variables. This decomposition
  leads to an efficient learning algorithm for both complete data and incomplete data
  with randomly missing individual observations, as the expensive repeated computation
  of the partition function can be avoided. We demonstrate our method on simulated
  data and real-world data in finance and genomics.
