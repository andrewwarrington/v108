title: One Sample Stochastic Frank-Wolfe
abstract: 'One of the beauties of the projected gradient descent method lies in its
  rather simple mechanism and yet stable  behavior with inexact, stochastic  gradients,
  which has led to its wide-spread use in many machine learning applications. However,
  once we replace the projection operator with a simpler linear program, as is done
  in the Frank-Wolfe method, both simplicity and  stability take a serious hit. The
  aim of this paper is to bring them back without sacrificing the efficiency.  In
  this paper, we propose the first one-sample stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm, called
  1-SFW,  that avoids the need to carefully tune the batch size, step size, learning
  rate, and other complicated hyper parameters. In particular, 1-SFW achieves the
  optimal  convergence rate  of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$  for reaching an  $\epsilon$-suboptimal
  solution in the stochastic convex setting, and a $(1-1/e)-\epsilon$ approximate
  solution for a stochastic  monotone DR-submodular maximization problem. Moreover,
  in a general non-convex setting, 1-SFW finds an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary
  point after at most $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ iterations, achieving the current
  best known convergence rate. All of this is possible by designing a novel unbiased
  momentum estimator that governs the stability of the optimization process while
  using a single sample at each iteration.  '
