title: Asymptotic Analysis of Sampling Estimators for Randomized Numerical Linear
  Algebra Algorithms
abstract: The statistical analysis of Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA)
  algorithms within the past few years has mostly focused on their performance as
  point estimators.  However, this is insufficient for conducting statistical inference,
  e.g., constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, since the distribution
  of the estimator is lacking.  In this article, we develop asymptotic analysis to
  derive the distribution of RandNLA sampling estimators for the least-squares problem.  In
  particular, we derive the asymptotic distribution of a general sampling estimator
  with arbitrary sampling probabilities.  The analysis is conducted in two complementary
  settings, i.e., when the objective of interest is to approximate the full sample
  estimator or is to infer the underlying ground truth model parameters.  For each
  setting, we show that the sampling estimator is asymptotically normally distributed
  under mild regularity conditions.  Moreover, the sampling estimator is asymptotically
  unbiased in both settings.  Based on our asymptotic analysis, we use two criteria,
  the Asymptotic Mean Squared Error (AMSE) and the Expected Asymptotic Mean Squared
  Error (EAMSE), to identify optimal sampling probabilities.  Several of these optimal
  sampling probability distributions are new to the literature, e.g., the root leverage
  sampling estimator and the predictor length sampling estimator.  Our theoretical
  results clarify the role of leverage in the sampling process, and our empirical
  results demonstrate improvements over existing methods.
