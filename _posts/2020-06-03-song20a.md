title: Improving Maximum Likelihood Training for Text Generation with Density Ratio
  Estimation
abstract: Autoregressive neural sequence generative models trained by Maximum Likelihood
  Estimation suffer the exposure bias problem in practical finite sample scenarios.
  The crux is that the number of training samples for Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  is usually limited and the input data distributions are different at training and
  inference stages. Many methods have been proposed to solve the above problem, which
  relies on sampling from the non-stationary model distribution and suffers from high
  variance or biased estimations. In this paper, we propose $\psi$-MLE, a new training
  scheme for autoregressive sequence generative models, which is effective and stable
  when operating at large sample space encountered in text generation.  We derive
  our algorithm from a new perspective of self-augmentation and introduce bias correction
  with density ratio estimation. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data
  and real-world text generation tasks demonstrate that our method stably outperforms
  Maximum Likelihood Estimation and other state-of-the-art sequence generative models
  in terms of both quality and diversity.
