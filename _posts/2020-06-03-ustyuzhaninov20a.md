title: Monotonic Gaussian Process Flows
abstract: 'We propose a new framework for imposing monotonicity constraints in a Bayesian
  non-parametric setting based on numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations.
  We derive a nonparametric model of monotonic functions that allows for interpretable
  priors and principled quantification of hierarchical uncertainty. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of the proposed model by providing competitive results to other probabilistic
  monotonic models on a number of benchmark functions. In addition, we consider the
  utility of a monotonic random process as a part of a hierarchical probabilistic
  model; we examine the task of temporal alignment of time-series data where it is
  beneficial to use a monotonic random process in order to preserve the uncertainty
  in the temporal warpings. '
