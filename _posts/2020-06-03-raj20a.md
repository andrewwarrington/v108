title: Importance Sampling via Local Sensitivity
abstract: Given a loss function $F:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R^+$ that can be written
  as the sum of losses over a large set of inputs $a_1,\ldots, a_n$,  it is often
  desirable to approximate $F$ by subsampling the input points. Strong theoretical
  guarantees require taking into account the importance of each point, measured by
  how much its individual loss contributes to $F(x)$. Maximizing this importance over
  all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ yields the \emph{sensitivity score} of $a_i$. Sampling with
  probabilities proportional to these scores gives strong guarantees, allowing one
  to approximately minimize of $F$ using just the subsampled points.Unfortunately,
  sensitivity sampling is difficult to apply since (1) it is unclear how to efficiently
  compute the sensitivity scores and (2) the sample size required is often impractically
  large. To overcome both obstacles we introduce \emph{local sensitivity}, which measures
  data point importance in a ball around some center $x_0$. We show that the local
  sensitivity can be efficiently estimated using the \emph{leverage scores} of a quadratic
  approximation to $F$ and that the sample size required to approximate $F$ around
  $x_0$ can be bounded. We propose employing local sensitivity sampling in an iterative
  optimization method  and analyze its convergence when $F$ is smooth and convex.
