title: 'FedPAQ: A Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Method with Periodic
  Averaging and Quantization'
abstract: 'Federated learning is a distributed framework according to which  a model
  is trained over a set of devices, while keeping data localized. This framework  faces
  several systems-oriented challenges which include (i) communication bottleneck since
  a large number of devices upload their local updates to a parameter server, and
  (ii) scalability as the federated network consists of millions of devices. Due to
  these systems challenges as well as issues related to statistical heterogeneity
  of data and privacy concerns, designing a provably efficient federated learning
  method is of significant importance yet it remains challenging. In this paper, we
  present FedPAQ, a communication-efficient Federated Learning method with Periodic
  Averaging and Quantization. FedPAQ relies on three key features: (1) periodic averaging
  where models are updated locally at devices and only periodically averaged at the
  server; (2) partial device participation where only a fraction of devices participate
  in each round of the training; and (3) quantized message-passing where the edge
  nodes quantize their updates before uploading to the parameter server. These features
  address the communications and scalability challenges in federated learning. We
  also show that FedPAQ achieves near-optimal theoretical guarantees for strongly
  convex and non-convex loss functions and empirically demonstrate the communication-computation
  tradeoff provided by our method.'
