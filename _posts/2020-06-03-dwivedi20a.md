title: Sharp Analysis of Expectation-Maximization for Weakly Identifiable Models
abstract: We study a class of weakly identifiable location-scale mixture models for
  which the maximum likelihood estimates based on $n$ i.i.d. samples are known to
  have lower accuracy than the classical $n^{- \frac{1}{2}}$ error. We investigate
  whether the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm also converges slowly for these
  models. We provide a rigorous characterization of EM for fitting a weakly identifiable
  Gaussian mixture in a univariate setting where we prove that the EM algorithm converges
  in order $n^{\frac{3}{4}}$ steps and returns estimates that are at a Euclidean distance
  of order ${ n^{- \frac{1}{8}}}$ and ${ n^{-\frac{1} {4}}}$ from the true location
  and scale parameter respectively. Establishing the slow rates in the univariate
  setting requires a novel localization argument with two stages, with each stage
  involving an epoch-based argument applied to a different surrogate EM operator at
  the population level.  We demonstrate several multivariate ($d \geq 2$) examples
  that exhibit the same slow rates as the univariate case. We also prove slow statistical
  rates in higher dimensions in a special case, when the fitted covariance is constrained
  to be a multiple of identity.
