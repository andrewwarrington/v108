title: Tight Analysis of Privacy and Utility Tradeoff in Approximate Differential
  Privacy
abstract: We characterize the minimum noise amplitude and power for noise-adding mechanisms
  in (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy for single real-valued query function.
  We derive new lower bounds using the duality of linear programming, and new upper
  bounds by analyzing a special class of (epsilon, delta)-differentially private mechanisms,
  the truncated Laplacian mechanisms. We show that the multiplicative gap of the lower
  bounds and upper bounds goes to zero in various high privacy regimes, proving the
  tightness of the lower and upper bounds. In particular, our results close the previous
  constant multiplicative gap in the discrete setting. Numeric experiments show the
  improvement of the truncated Laplacian mechanism over the optimal Gaussian mechanism
  in all privacy regimes.
