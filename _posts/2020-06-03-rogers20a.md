title: Guaranteed Validity for Empirical Approaches to Adaptive Data Analysis
abstract: We design a general framework for answering adaptive statistical queries
  that focuses on providing explicit confidence intervals along with point estimates.
  Prior work in this area has either focused on providing tight confidence intervals
  for specific analyses, or providing general worst-case bounds for point estimates.
  Unfortunately, as we observe, these worst-case bounds are loose in many settings
  â€” often not even beating simple baselines like sample splitting. Our main contribution
  is to design a framework for providing valid, instance-specific confidence intervals
  for point estimates that can be generated by heuristics. When paired with good heuristics,
  this method gives guarantees that are orders of magnitude better than the best worst-case
  bounds. We provide a Python library implementing our method.
