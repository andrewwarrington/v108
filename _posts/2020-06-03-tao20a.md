title: Variational Optimization on Lie Groups, with Examples of Leading (Generalized)
  Eigenvalue Problems
abstract: 'The article considers smooth optimization of functions on Lie groups. By
  generalizing NAG variational principle in vector space (Wibisono et al., 2016) to
  general Lie groups, continuous Lie-NAG dynamics which are guaranteed to converge
  to local optimum are obtained. They correspond to momentum versions of gradient
  flow on Lie groups. A particular case of $\SO(n)$ is then studied in details, with
  objective functions corresponding to leading Generalized EigenValue problems: the
  Lie-NAG dynamics are first made explicit in coordinates, and then discretized in
  structure preserving fashions, resulting in optimization algorithms with faithful
  energy behavior (due to conformal symplecticity) and exactly remaining on the Lie
  group. Stochastic gradient versions are also investigated. Numerical experiments
  on both synthetic data and practical problem (LDA for MNIST) demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed methods as optimization algorithms (\emph{not} as a classification
  method).'
