title: 'Wasserstein Smoothing: Certified Robustness against Wasserstein Adversarial
  Attacks'
abstract: 'In the last couple of years, several adversarial attack methods based on
  different threat models have been proposed for the image classification problem.
  Most existing defenses consider additive threat models in which sample perturbations
  have bounded L_p norms. These defenses, however, can be vulnerable against adversarial
  attacks under non-additive threat models. An example of an attack method based on
  a non-additive threat model is the Wasserstein adversarial attack proposed by Wong
  et al. (2019), where the distance between an image and its adversarial example is
  determined by the Wasserstein metric ("earth-mover distance") between their normalized
  pixel intensities. Until now, there has been no certifiable defense against this
  type of attack. In this work, we propose the first defense with certified robustness
  against Wasserstein adversarial attacks using randomized smoothing. We develop this
  certificate by considering the space of possible flows between images, and representing
  this space such that Wasserstein distance between images is upper-bounded by L_1
  distance in this flow-space. We can then apply existing randomized smoothing certificates
  for the L_1 metric.  In MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we find that our proposed defense
  is also practically effective, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy under
  Wasserstein adversarial attack compared to unprotected models. '
