title: 'Hermitian matrices for clustering directed graphs: insights and applications'
abstract: 'Graph clustering is a basic technique in machine learning, and has widespread
  applications in different domains. While spectral techniques have been successfully
  applied for clustering undirected graphs, the performance of spectral clustering
  algorithms for directed graphs (digraphs) is not in general satisfactory: these
  algorithms usually require  symmetrising the matrix representing a digraph, and
  typical objective functions for undirected graph clustering   do not capture  cluster-structures
  in which the information given by the direction of the edges is crucial. To overcome
  these downsides,  we propose  a spectral clustering algorithm based on a complex-valued
  matrix representation of digraphs. We analyse its theoretical performance on a Stochastic
  Block Model for digraphs in which the cluster-structure is given not only by variations
  in edge densities, but also by the direction of the edges. The significance of our
  work is   highlighted  on a data set pertaining to internal migration in the United
  States: while previous spectral clustering algorithms for digraphs can only reveal
  that people are more likely to move between counties that are geographically close,
  our approach is able to cluster together counties with  a similar socio-economical
  profile even when they are geographically distant, and illustrates how people tend
  to move from rural to more urbanised areas.'
