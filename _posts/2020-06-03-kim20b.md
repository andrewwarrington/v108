title: On casting importance weighted autoencoder to an EM algorithm to learn deep
  generative models
abstract: We propose a new and general approach to learn deep generative models. Our
  approach is based on a new observation that the importance weighted autoencoders
  (IWAE, Burda et al. (2015)) can be understood as a procedure of estimating the MLE
  with an EM algorithm. Utilizing this interpretation, we develop a new learning algorithm
  called importance weighted EM algorithm (IWEM). IWEM is an EM algorithm with self-normalized
  importance sampling (snIS) where the proposal distribution is carefully selected
  to reduce the variance due to snIS. In addition, we devise an annealing strategy
  to stabilize the learning algorithm. For missing data problems, we propose a modified
  IWEM algorithm called miss-IWEM. Using multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
  empirically that our proposed methods outperform IWAE with significant margins for
  both fully-observed and missing data cases.
