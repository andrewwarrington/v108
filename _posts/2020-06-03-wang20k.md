title: Online Batch Decision-Making with High-Dimensional Covariates
abstract: We propose and investigate a class of new algorithms for sequential decision
  making that interacts with a batch of users simultaneously instead of a user at
  each decision epoch. This type of batch models is motivated by interactive marketing
  and clinical trial, where a group of people are treated simultaneously and the outcomes
  of the whole group are collected before the next stage of decision. In such a scenario,
  our goal is to allocate a batch of treatments to maximize treatment efficacy based
  on observed high-dimensional user covariates. We deliver a solution, named Teamwork
  LASSO Bandit algorithm, that resolves a batch version of explore-exploit dilemma
  via switching between teamwork stage and selfish stage during the whole decision
  process. This is made possible based on statistical properties of LASSO estimate
  of treatment efficacy that adapts to a sequence of batch observations. In general,
  a rate of optimal allocation condition is proposed to delineate the exploration
  and exploitation trade-off on the data collection scheme, which is sufficient for
  LASSO to identify the optimal treatment for observed user covariates. An upper bound
  on expected cumulative regret of the proposed algorithm is provided.
