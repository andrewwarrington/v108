title: The Sylvester Graphical Lasso (SyGlasso)
abstract: This paper introduces the Sylvester graphical lasso (SyGlasso) that captures
  multiway dependencies present in tensor-valued data. The model is based on the Sylvester
  equation that defines a generative model. The proposed model complements the tensor
  graphical lasso (Greenewald et al., 2019) that imposes a Kronecker sum model for
  the inverse covariance matrix, by providing an alternative Kronecker sum model that
  is generative and interpretable. A nodewise regression approach is adopted for estimating
  the conditional independence relationships among variables. The statistical convergence
  of the method is established, and empirical studies are provided to demonstrate
  the recovery of meaningful conditional dependency graphs. We apply the SyGlasso
  to an electroencephalography (EEG) study to compare the brain connectivity of alcoholic
  and nonalcoholic subjects. We demonstrate that our model can simultaneously estimate
  both the brain connectivity and its temporal dependencies.
