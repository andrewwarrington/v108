title: " Modular Block-diagonal Curvature Approximations for Feedforward Architectures"
abstract: We propose a modular extension of backpropagation for the computation of
  block-diagonal approximations to various curvature matrices of the training objective
  (in particular, the Hessian, generalized Gauss-Newton, and positive-curvature Hessian).
  The approach reduces the otherwise tedious manual derivation of these matrices into
  local modules, and is easy to integrate into existing machine learning libraries.
  Moreover, we develop a compact notation derived from matrix differential calculus.
  We outline different strategies applicable to our method. They subsume recently-proposed
  block-diagonal approximations as special cases, and are extended to convolutional
  neural networks in this work.
