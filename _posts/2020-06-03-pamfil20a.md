title: 'DYNOTEARS: Structure Learning from Time-Series Data'
abstract: We revisit the structure learning problem for dynamic Bayesian networks
  and propose a method that simultaneously estimates contemporaneous (intra-slice)
  and time-lagged (inter-slice) relationships between variables in a time-series.
  Our approach is score-based, and revolves around minimizing a penalized loss subject
  to an acyclicity constraint. To solve this problem, we leverage a recent algebraic
  result characterizing the acyclicity constraint as a smooth equality constraint.
  The resulting algorithm, which we call DYNOTEARS, outperforms other methods on simulated
  data, especially in high-dimensions as the number of variables increases. We also
  apply this algorithm on real datasets from two different domains, finance and molecular
  biology, and analyze the resulting output. Compared to state-of-the-art methods
  for learning dynamic Bayesian networks, our method is both scalable and accurate
  on real data. The simple formulation and competitive performance of our method make
  it suitable for a variety of problems where one seeks to learn connections between
  variables across time.
