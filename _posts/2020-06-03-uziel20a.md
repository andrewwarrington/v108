title: Long-and Short-Term Forecasting for  Portfolio Selection with Transaction Costs
abstract: "\tIn this paper we focus on the problem of online portfolio selection with
  transaction costs. We tackle this problem using a novel approach for combining the
  predictions of long-term experts with those of short-term experts so as\tto effectively
  reduce transaction costs.  We prove that the new strategy \tmaintains bounded regret
  relative to the performance of the best possible combination (switching times) of
  the long-and short-term experts.\tWe empirically validate our approach on several
  standard benchmark datasets.\tThese studies indicate that the proposed approach
  \tachieves state-of-the-art performance."
