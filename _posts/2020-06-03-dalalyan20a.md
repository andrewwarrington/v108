title: A nonasymptotic law of iterated logarithm for general M-estimators
abstract: M-estimators are ubiquitous in machine learning and statistical learning
  theory.  They are used both for defining prediction strategies and  for  evaluating  their  precision.   In  this
  paper, we propose the first non-asymptotic ’any-time’ deviation bounds for general
  M-estimators, where ’any-time’ means that the bound holds with a prescribed probability
  for every  sample  size.   These  bounds  are  non-asymptotic versions of the law
  of iterated logarithm.  They are established under general assumptions such as Lipschitz
  continuity of the loss function and (local) curvature of thepopulation risk.  These
  conditions are satisfied for most examples used in machine learning, including those
  ensuring robustness to outliers and to heavy tailed distributions.  As an example
  of application, we consider the problem of best arm identification in a stochastic
  multi-arm bandit setting.  We show that the established  bound  can  be  converted  into  a
  new  algorithm,  with  provably  optimal  theoretical guarantees.  Numerical experiments
  illustrating the validity of the algorithm are reported.
