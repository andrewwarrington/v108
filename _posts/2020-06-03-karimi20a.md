title: Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations for Consequential Decisions
abstract: 'Predictive models are being increasingly used to support consequential
  decision making at the individual level in contexts such as pretrial bail and loan
  approval. As a result, there is increasing social and legal pressure to provide
  explanations that help the affected individuals not only to understand why a prediction
  was output, but also how to act to obtain a desired outcome. To this end, several
  works have proposed optimization-based methods to generate nearest counterfactual
  explanations. However, these methods are often restricted to a particular subset
  of models (e.g., decision trees or linear models) and differentiable distance functions.
  In contrast, we build on standard theory and tools from formal verification and
  propose a novel algorithm that solves a sequence of satisfiability problems, where
  both the distance function (objective) and predictive model (constraints) are represented
  as logic formulae. As shown by our experiments on real-world data, our algorithm
  is: i) model-agnostic ({non-}linear, {non-}differentiable, {non-}convex); ii) data-type-agnostic
  (heterogeneous features); iii) distance-agnostic (l0, l1, l8, and combinations thereof);
  iv) able to generate plausible and diverse counterfactuals for any sample (i.e.,
  100% coverage); and v) at provably optimal distances.'
