title: 'Radial Bayesian Neural Networks: Beyond Discrete Support In Large-Scale Bayesian
  Deep Learning'
abstract: 'We propose Radial Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs): a variational approximate
  posterior for BNNs which scales well to large models.  Unlike scalable Bayesian
  deep learning methods like deep ensembles that have discrete support (assign exactly
  zero probability almost everywhere in weight-space) Radial BNNs maintain full support;
  letting them act as a prior for continual learning and avoiding the a priori implausibility
  of discrete support.  Our method avoids a sampling problem in mean-field variational
  inference (MFVI) caused by the so-called ’soap-bubble’ pathology of multivariate
  Gaussians.  We show that, unlike MFVI, Radial BNNs are robust to hyperparameters
  and can be efficiently applied to challenging real-world tasks without needing ad-hoc
  tweaks and intensive tuning: on a real-world medical imaging task Radial BNNs outperform
  MC dropout and deep ensembles.'
