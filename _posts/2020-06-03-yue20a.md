title: Discrete Action On-Policy Learning with Action-Value Critic
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) in discrete action space is ubiquitous in real-world
  applications, but its complexity grows exponentially with the action-space dimension,
  making it challenging to apply existing on-policy gradient based deep RL algorithms
  efficiently. To effectively operate in multidimensional discrete action spaces,
  we construct a critic to estimate action-value functions, apply it on correlated
  actions, and combine these critic estimated action values to control the variance
  of gradient estimation. We follow rigorous statistical analysis to design how to
  generate and combine these correlated actions, and how to sparsify the gradients
  by shutting down the contributions from certain dimensions. These efforts result
  in a new discrete action on-policy RL algorithm that empirically outperforms related
  on-policy algorithms relying on variance control techniques. We demonstrate these
  properties on OpenAI Gym benchmark tasks, and illustrate how discretizing the action
  space could benefit the exploration phase and hence facilitate convergence to a
  better local optimal solution thanks to the flexibility of discrete policy. '
