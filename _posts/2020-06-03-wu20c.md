title: Stochastic Linear Contextual Bandits with Diverse Contexts
abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate the impact of context diversity on stochastic
  linear contextual bandits. As opposed to the previous view that contexts lead to
  more difficult bandit learning, we show that when the contexts are sufficiently
  diverse, the learner is able to utilize the information obtained during exploitation
  to shorten the exploration process, thus achieving reduced regret. We design the
  LinUCB-d algorithm, and propose a novel approach to analyze its regret performance.
  The main theoretical result is that under the diverse context assumption, the cumulative
  expected regret of LinUCB-d is bounded by a constant. As a by-product, our results
  improve the previous understanding of LinUCB and strengthen its performance guarantee. '
