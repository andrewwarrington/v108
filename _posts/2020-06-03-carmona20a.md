title: 'Semi-Modular Inference: enhanced learning in multi-modular models by tempering
  the influence of components'
abstract: Bayesian statistical inference loses predictive optimality when generative
  models are misspecified.Working within an existing coherent loss-based generalisation
  of Bayesian inference, we show existing Modular/Cut-model inference is coherent,
  and write down a new family of Semi-Modular Inference (SMI) schemes, indexed by
  an influence parameter, with Bayesian inference and Cut-models as special cases.
  We give a meta-learning criterion and estimation procedure to choose the inference
  scheme. This returns Bayesian inference when there is no misspecification.The framework
  applies naturally to Multi-modular models. Cut-model inference allows directed information
  flow from well-specified modules to misspecified modules, but not vice versa. An
  existing alternative power posterior method gives tunable but undirected control
  of information flow, improving prediction in some settings. In contrast, SMI allows
  \emph{tunable and directed} information flow between modules.We illustrate our methods
  on two standard test cases from the literature and a motivating archaeological data
  set.
