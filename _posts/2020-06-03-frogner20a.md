title: Approximate Inference with Wasserstein Gradient Flows
abstract: We present a novel approximate inference method for diffusion processes,
  based on the Wasserstein gradient flow formulation of the diffusion. In this formulation,
  the time-dependent density of the diffusion is derived as the limit of implicit
  Euler steps that follow the gradients of a particular free energy functional. Existing
  methods for computing Wasserstein gradient flows rely on discretization of the domain
  of the diffusion, prohibiting their application to domains in more than several
  dimensions. We propose instead a discretization-free inference method that computes
  the Wasserstein gradient flow directly in a space of continuous functions. We characterize
  approximation properties of the proposed method and evaluate it on a nonlinear filtering
  task, finding performance comparable to the state-of-the-art for filtering diffusions.
