title: Sample Complexity of Reinforcement Learning using Linearly Combined Model Ensembles
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been shown to be capable of learning
  intelligent behavior in rich domains. However, this has largely been done in simulated
  domains without adequate focus on the process of building the simulator. In this
  paper, we consider a setting where we have access to an ensemble of pre-trained
  and possibly inaccurate simulators (models). We approximate the real environment
  using a state-dependent linear combination of the ensemble, where the coefficients
  are determined by the given state features and some unknown parameters. Our proposed
  algorithm provably learns a near-optimal policy with a sample complexity polynomial
  in the number of unknown parameters, and incurs no dependence on the size of the
  state (or action) space. As an extension, we also consider the more challenging
  problem of model selection, where the state features are unknown and can be chosen
  from a large candidate set. We provide exponential lower bounds that illustrate
  the fundamental hardness of this problem, and develop a provably efficient algorithm
  under additional natural assumptions.
