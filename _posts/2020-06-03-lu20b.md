title: Interpretable Deep Gaussian Processes with Moments
abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) combine the the expressiveness of Deep Neural
  Networks (DNNs) with quantified uncertainty of Gaussian Processes (GPs). Expressive
  power and intractable inference both result from the non-Gaussian distribution over
  composition functions. We propose interpretable DGP based on approximating DGP as
  a GP by calculating the exact moments, which additionally identify the heavy-tailed
  nature of some DGP distributions. Consequently, our approach admits interpretation
  as both NNs with specified activation functions and as a variational approximation
  to DGP. We identify the expressivity parameter of DGP and find non-local and non-stationary
  correlation from DGP composition. We provide general recipes for deriving the effective
  kernels for DGP of two, three, or infinitely many layers, composed of homogeneous
  or heterogeneous kernels. Results illustrate the expressiveness of our effective
  kernels through samples from the prior and inference on simulated and real data
  and demonstrate advantages of interpretability by analysis of analytic forms, and
  draw relations and equivalences across kernels.
