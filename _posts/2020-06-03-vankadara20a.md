title: On the optimality of kernels for high-dimensional clustering
abstract: " This paper studies the optimality of kernel methods in high dimensional
  data clustering. Recent works have studied the large sample performance of kernel
  clustering in the high dimensional regime, where Euclidean distance becomes less
  informative. However, it is unknown whether popular methods, such as kernel k-means,
  are optimal in this regime.   We consider the problem of high dimensional Gaussian
  clustering and show that, with the exponential kernel function, the sufficient conditions
  for partial recovery of clusters using the NP-hard kernel k-means objective matches
  the known information-theoretic limit up to a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. It also exactly
  matches the known upper bounds for the non-kernel setting. We also show that a semi-definite
  relaxation of the kernel k-means procedure matches up to constant factors, the spectral
  threshold, below which no polynomial-time algorithm is known to succeed. This is
  the first work that provides such optimality guarantees for the kernel k-means as
  well as its convex relaxation. Our proofs demonstrate the utility of the less known
  polynomial concentration results for random variables with exponentially decaying
  tails in the higher-order analysis of kernel methods."
