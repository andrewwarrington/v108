title: Dynamical Systems Theory for Causal Inference with Application to Synthetic
  Control Methods
abstract: In this paper, we adopt results in nonlinear time series analysis for causal
  inference in dynamical settings. Our motivation is policy analysis with panel data,
  particularly  through the use of “synthetic control" methods. These methods regress
  pre-intervention outcomes of the treated unit to outcomes from a pool of control
  units, and then use the fitted regression model to estimate causal effects post-intervention.
  In this setting, we propose to screen out control units that have a weak dynamical
  relationship to the treated unit. In simulations, we show that this method can mitigate
  bias from “cherry-picking" of control units, which is usually an important concern.
  We illustrate on real-world applications, including the tobacco legislation example
  of \citet{Abadie2010}, and Brexit.
