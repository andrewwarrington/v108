title: Fast Algorithms for Computational Optimal Transport and Wasserstein Barycenter
abstract: We provide theoretical complexity analysis for new algorithms to compute
  the optimal transport (OT) distance between two discrete probability distributions,
  and demonstrate their favorable practical performance compared to state-of-art primal-dual
  algorithms. First, we introduce the \emph{accelerated primal-dual randomized coordinate
  descent} (APDRCD) algorithm for computing the OT distance. We show that its complexity
  is $\bigOtil(\frac{n^{5/2}}{\varepsilon})$, where $n$ stands for the number of atoms
  of these probability measures and $\varepsilon > 0$ is the desired accuracy. This
  complexity bound matches the best known complexities of primal-dual algorithms for
  the OT problems, including the adaptive primal-dual accelerated gradient descent
  (APDAGD) and the adaptive primal-dual accelerated mirror descent (APDAMD) algorithms.
  Then, we demonstrate the improved practical efficiency of the APDRCD algorithm through
  extensive comparative experimental studies.  We also propose a greedy version of
  APDRCD, which we refer to as \emph{accelerated primal-dual greedy coordinate descent}
  (APDGCD), to further enhance practical performance. Finally, we generalize the APDRCD
  and APDGCD algorithms to distributed algorithms for computing the Wasserstein barycenter
  for multiple probability distributions.
