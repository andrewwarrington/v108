title: Contextual Constrained Learning for Dose-Finding Clinical Trials
abstract: Clinical trials in the medical domain are constrained by budgets. The number
  of patients that can be recruited is therefore limited. When a patient population
  is heterogeneous, this creates difficulties in learning subgroup specific responses
  to a particular drug and especially for a variety of dosages. In addition, patient
  recruitment can be difficult by the fact that clinical trials do not aim to provide
  a benefit to any given patient in the trial. In this paper, we propose C3T-Budget,
  a contextual constrained clinical trial algorithm for dose-finding under both budget
  and safety constraints. The algorithm aims to maximize drug efficacy within the
  clinical trial while also learning about the drug being tested. C3T-Budget recruits
  patients with consideration of the remaining budget, the remaining time, and the
  characteristics of each group, such as the population distribution, estimated expected
  efficacy, and estimation credibility. In addition, the algorithm aims to avoid unsafe
  dosages. These characteristics are further illustrated in a simulated clinical trial
  study, which corroborates the theoretical analysis and demonstrates an efficient
  budget usage as well as a balanced learning-treatment trade-off.
