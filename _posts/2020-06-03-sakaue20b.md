title: 'On Maximization of Weakly Modular Functions: Guarantees of Multi-stage Algorithms,
  Tractability, and Hardness'
abstract: Maximization of {\it non-submodular} functions appears in various scenarios,
  and many previous works studied it based on some measures that quantify the closeness
  to being submodular. On the other hand, some practical non-submodular functions
  are actually close to being {\it modular}, which has been utilized in few studies.
  In this paper, we study cardinality-constrained maximization of {\it weakly modular}
  functions, whose closeness to being modular is measured by {\it submodularity} and
  {\it supermodularity ratios}, and reveal what we can and cannot do by using the
  weak modularity. We first show that guarantees of multi-stage algorithms can be
  proved with the weak modularity, which generalize and improve some existing results,
  and experiments confirm their effectiveness. We then show that weakly modular maximization
  is {\it fixed-parameter tractable} under certain conditions; as a byproduct, we
  provide a new timeâ€“accuracy trade-off for $\ell_0$-constrained minimization. We
  finally prove that, even if objective functions are weakly modular, no polynomial-time
  algorithms can improve the existing approximation guarantee achieved by the greedy
  algorithm in general.
