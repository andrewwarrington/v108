title: 'Learning Hierarchical Interactions at Scale: A Convex Optimization Approach'
abstract: 'In many learning settings, it is beneficial to augment the main features
  with pairwise interactions. Such interaction models can be often enhanced by performing
  variable selection under the so-called strong hierarchy constraint: an interaction
  is non-zero only if its associated main features are non-zero. Existing convex optimization-based
  algorithms face difficulties in handling problems where the number of main features
  p   10^3 (with total number of features   p^2). In this paper, we study a convex
  relaxation which enforces strong hierarchy and develop a highly scalable algorithm
  based on proximal gradient descent. We introduce novel screening rules that allow
  for solving the complicated proximal problem in parallel. In addition, we introduce
  a specialized active-set strategy with gradient screening for avoiding costly gradient
  computations. The framework can handle problems having dense design matrices, with
  p = 50,000 (  10^9 interactions)—instances that are much larger than the state of
  the art. Experiments on real and synthetic data suggest that our toolkit hierScale
  outperforms the state of the art in terms of prediction and variable selection and
  can achieve over a 4900x speed-up.'
