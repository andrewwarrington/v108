title: Learning Gaussian Graphical Models via Multiplicative Weights
abstract: Graphical model selection in Markov random fields is a fundamental problem
  in statistics and machine learning.  Two particularly prominent models, the Ising
  model and Gaussian model, have largely developed in parallel using different (though
  often related) techniques, and several practical algorithms with rigorous sample
  complexity bounds have been established for each.  In this paper, we adapt a recently
  proposed algorithm of Klivans and Meka (FOCS, 2017), based on the method of multiplicative
  weight updates, from the Ising model to the Gaussian model, via non-trivial modifications
  to both the algorithm and its analysis.  The algorithm enjoys a sample complexity
  bound that is qualitatively similar to others in the literature, has a low runtime
  $O(mp^2)$ in the case of $m$ samples and $p$ nodes, and can trivially be implemented
  in an online manner.
