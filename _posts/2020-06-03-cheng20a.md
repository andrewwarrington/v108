title: 'Online Learning with Continuous Variations: Dynamic Regret and Reductions'
abstract: Online learning is a powerful tool for analyzing iterative algorithms. However,
  the classic adversarial setup fails to capture regularity  that can exist in practice.
  Motivated by this observation, we establish a new setup, called Continuous Online
  Learning (COL), where the gradient of online loss function changes continuously
  across rounds with respect to the learnerâ€™s decisions. We show that COL appropriately
  describes many interesting applications, from general equilibrium problems (EPs)
  to optimization in episodic MDPs. Using this new setup, we revisit the difficulty
  of sublinear dynamic regret. We prove a fundamental equivalence between achieving
  sublinear dynamic regret in COL and solving certain EPs. With this insight, we offer
  conditions for efficient algorithms that achieve sublinear dynamic regret, even
  when the losses are chosen adaptively without any a priori variation budget. Furthermore,
  we show for COL a reduction from dynamic regret to both static regret and convergence
  in the associated EP, allowing us to analyze the dynamic regret of many existing
  algorithms.
