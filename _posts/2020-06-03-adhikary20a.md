title: Expressiveness and Learning of Hidden Quantum Markov Models
abstract: Extending classical probabilistic reasoning using the quantum mechanical
  view of probability has been of recent interest, particularly in the development
  of hidden quantum Markov models (HQMMs) to model stochastic processes. However,
  there has been little progress in characterizing the expressiveness of such models
  and learning them from data. We tackle these problems by showing that HQMMs are
  a special subclass of the general class of observable operator models (OOMs) that
  do not suffer from the negative probability problem by design. We also provide a
  feasible retraction-based learning algorithm for HQMMs using constrained gradient
  descent on the Stiefel manifold of model parameters. We demonstrate that this approach
  is faster and scales to larger models than previous learning algorithms.
