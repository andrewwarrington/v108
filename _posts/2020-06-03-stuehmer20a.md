title: Independent Subspace Analysis for Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations
abstract: 'Recently there has been an increased interest in unsupervised learning
  of disentangled representations using the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework.
  Most of the existing work has focused largely on modifying the variational cost
  function to achieve this goal. We first show that these modifications, e.g. beta-VAE,
  simplify the tendency of variational inference to underfit, causing pathological
  over-pruning and over-orthogonalization of learned components. Second, we propose
  a complementary approach: to modify the probabilistic model with a structured latent
  prior. This prior discovers latent variable representations that are structured
  into a hierarchy of independent vector spaces. The proposed prior has three major
  advantages: First, in contrast to the standard VAE normal prior, the proposed prior
  is not rotationally invariant. This feature of our approach resolves the problem
  of unidentifiability of the standard VAE normal prior. Second, we demonstrate that
  the proposed prior encourages a disentangled latent representation which facilitates
  learning of disentangled representations. Third, extensive quantitative experiments
  demonstrate that the prior significantly mitigates the trade-off between reconstruction
  loss and disentanglement over the state of the art.'
