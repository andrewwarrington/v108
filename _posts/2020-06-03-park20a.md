title: Unsupervised Neural Universal Denoiser for Finite-Input General-Output Noisy
  Channel
abstract: 'We devise a novel neural network-based universal denoiser for the finite-input,
  general-output (FIGO) channel. Based on the assumption of known noisy channel densities,
  which is realistic in many practical scenarios, we train the network such that it
  can denoise as well as the best sliding window denoiser for any given underlying
  clean source data. Our algorithm, dubbed as Generalized CUDE (Gen-CUDE), enjoys
  several desirable properties; it can be trained in an unsupervised manner (solely
  based on the noisy observation data), has much smaller computational complexity
  compared to the previously developed universal denoiser for the same setting, and
  has much tighter upper bound on the denoising performance, which is obtained by
  a theoretical analysis. In our experiments, we show such tighter upper bound is
  also realized in practice by showing that Gen-CUDE achieves much better denoising
  results compared to other strong baselines for both synthetic and real underlying
  clean sequences. '
