title: Guarantees of Stochastic Greedy Algorithms for Non-monotone Submodular Maximization
abstract: Submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint can model various
  problems, and those problems are often very large in practice. For the case where
  objective functions are monotone, many fast approximation algorithms have been developed.
  The stochastic greedy algorithm (SG) is one such algorithm, which is widely used
  thanks to its simplicity, efficiency, and high empirical performance. However, its
  approximation guarantee has been proved only for monotone objective functions. When
  it comes to non-monotone objective functions, existing approximation algorithms
  are inefficient relative to the fast algorithms developed for the case of monotone
  objectives. In this paper, we prove that SG (with slight modification) can achieve
  almost $1/4$-approximation guarantees in expectation in linear time even if objective
  functions are non-monotone. Our result provides a constant-factor approximation
  algorithm with the fewest oracle queries for non-monotone submodular maximization
  with a cardinality constraint. Experiments validate the performance of (modified)
  SG.
