title: Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Classification with Gaussian Processes
abstract: We investigate adversarial robustness of Gaussian Process classification
  (GPC) models. Specifically, given a compact subset of the input space $T\subseteq
  \mathbb{R}^d$ enclosing a test point $x^*$ and a GPC trained on a dataset $\mathcal{D}$,
  we aim to compute the minimum and the maximum classification probability for the
  GPC over all the points in $T$.In order to do so, we show how functions lower- and
  upper-bounding the GPC output in $T$ can be derived, and implement those in a branch
  and bound optimisation algorithm. For any error threshold $\epsilon > 0$ selected
  \emph{a priori}, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to reach values $\epsilon$-close
  to the actual values in finitely many iterations.We apply our method to investigate
  the robustness of GPC models on a 2D synthetic dataset, the SPAM dataset and a subset
  of the MNIST dataset, providing comparisons of different GPC training techniques,
  and show how our method can be used for interpretability analysis. Our empirical
  analysis suggests that GPC robustness increases with more accurate posterior estimation.
