title: MAP Inference for Customized Determinantal Point Processes via Maximum Inner
  Product Search
abstract: 'Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are a good fit for modeling diversity
  in many machine learning applications.  For instance, in recommender systems, one
  might have a basic DPP defined by item features, and a customized version of this
  DPP for each user with features re-weighted according to user preferences.  While
  such models perform well, they are typically applied only to relatively small datasets,
  because existing maximum a posteriori (MAP) approximation algorithms are expensive.  In
  this work, we propose a new MAP algorithm: we show that, by performing a one-time
  preprocessing step on a basic DPP, it is possible to run an approximate version
  of the standard greedy MAP approximation algorithm on any customized version of
  the DPP in time sublinear in the number of items.  Our key observation is that the
  core computation can be written as a maximum inner product search (MIPS), which
  allows us to accelerate inference via approximate MIPS structures, e.g., trees or
  hash tables.  We provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithmâ€™s approximation
  quality, as well as empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrating that
  it is often orders of magnitude faster while sacrificing little accuracy.'
