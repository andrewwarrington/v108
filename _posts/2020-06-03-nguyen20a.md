title: Distributionally Robust Bayesian Quadrature Optimization
abstract: Bayesian quadrature optimization (BQO) maximizes the expectation of an expensive
  black-box integrand taken over a known probability distribution. In this work, we
  study BQO under distributional uncertainty in which the underlying probability distribution
  is unknown except for a limited set of its i.i.d samples. A standard BQO approach
  maximizes the Monte Carlo estimate of the true expected objective given the fixed
  sample set. Though Monte Carlo estimate is unbiased, it has high variance given
  a small set of samples; thus can result in a spurious objective function. We adopt
  the distributionally robust optimization perspective to this problem by maximizing
  the expected objective under the most adversarial distribution. In particular, we
  propose a novel posterior sampling based algorithm, namely distributionally robust
  BQO (DRBQO) for this purpose. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our
  proposed framework in synthetic and real-world problems, and characterize its theoretical
  convergence via Bayesian regret.
