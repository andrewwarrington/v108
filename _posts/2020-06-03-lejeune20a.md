title: Thresholding Graph Bandits with GrAPL
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new online decision making paradigm that we
  call Thresholding Graph Bandits. The main goal is to efficiently identify a subset
  of arms in a multi-armed bandit problem whose means are above a specified threshold.
  While traditionally in such problems, the arms are assumed to be independent, in
  our paradigm we further suppose that we have access to the similarity between the
  arms in the form of a graph, allowing us to gain information about the arm means
  with fewer samples. Such a feature is particularly relevant in modern decision making
  problems, where rapid decisions need to be made in spite of the large number of
  options available. We present GrAPL, a novel algorithm for the thresholding graph
  bandit problem. We demonstrate theoretically that this algorithm is effective in
  taking advantage of the graph structure when the structure is reflective of the
  distribution of the rewards. We confirm these theoretical findings via experiments
  on both synthetic and real data.
