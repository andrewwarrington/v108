title: Elimination of All Bad Local Minima in Deep Learning
abstract: 'In this paper, we theoretically prove that adding one special neuron per
  output unit eliminates all suboptimal local minima of any deep neural network, for
  multi-class classification, binary classification, and regression with an arbitrary
  loss function, under practical assumptions. At every local minimum of any deep neural
  network with these added neurons, the set of parameters of the original neural network
  (without added neurons) is guaranteed to be a global minimum of the original neural
  network. The effects of the added neurons are proven to automatically vanish at
  every local minimum. Moreover, we provide a novel theoretical characterization of
  a failure mode of eliminating suboptimal local minima via an additional theorem
  and several examples. This paper also introduces a novel proof technique based on
  the perturbable gradient basis (PGB) necessary condition of local minima, which
  provides new insight into the elimination of local minima and is applicable to analyze
  various models and transformations of objective functions beyond the elimination
  of local minima. '
