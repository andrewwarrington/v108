title: A Primal-Dual Solver for Large-Scale Tracking-by-Assignment
abstract: We propose a fast approximate solver for the combinatorial problem known
  as tracking-by-assignment, which we apply to cell tracking. The latter plays a key
  role in discovery in many life sciences, especially in cell and developmental biology.
  So far, in the most general setting this problem was addressed by off-the-shelf
  solvers like Gurobi, whose run time and memory requirements rapidly grow with the
  size of the input. In contrast, for our method this growth is nearly linear. Our
  contribution consists of a new (1) decomposable compact representation of the problem;
  (2) dual block-coordinate ascent method for optimizing the decomposition-based dual;
  and (3) primal heuristics that reconstructs a feasible integer solution based on
  the dual information. Compared to solving the problem with Gurobi, we observe an
  up to 60 times speed-up, while reducing the memory footprint significantly. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method on real-world tracking problems.
