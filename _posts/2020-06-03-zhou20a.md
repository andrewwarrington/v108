title: Stochastic Recursive Variance-Reduced Cubic Regularization Methods
abstract: 'Stochastic Variance-Reduced Cubic regularization (SVRC) algorithms have
  received increasing attention due to its improved gradient/Hessian complexities
  (i.e., number of queries to stochastic gradient/Hessian oracles)  to find local
  minima for nonconvex finite-sum optimization. However, it is unclear whether existing
  SVRC algorithms can be further improved. Moreover, the semi-stochastic Hessian estimator
  adopted in existing SVRC algorithms prevents the use of Hessian-vector product-based
  fast cubic subproblem solvers, which makes SVRC algorithms computationally intractable
  for high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we first present a Stochastic Recursive
  Variance-Reduced Cubic regularization method (SRVRC) using a recursively updated
  semi-stochastic gradient and Hessian estimators. It enjoys improved gradient and
  Hessian complexities to find an $(\epsilon, \sqrt{\epsilon})$-approximate local
  minimum, and outperforms the state-of-the-art SVRC algorithms.  Built upon SRVRC,
  we further propose a Hessian-free SRVRC algorithm, namely SRVRC$_{\text{free}}$,
  which only needs $\tilde O(n\epsilon^{-2} \land \epsilon^{-3})$ stochastic gradient
  and Hessian-vector product computations, where $n$ is the number of component functions
  in the finite-sum objective and $\epsilon$ is the optimization precision. This outperforms
  the best-known result $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ achieved by stochastic cubic regularization
  algorithm proposed in \cite{tripuraneni2018stochastic}. '
