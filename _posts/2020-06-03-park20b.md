title: Calibrated Prediction with Covariate Shift via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are an important tool for helping autonomous
  agents or human decision makers understand and lever-age predictive models. However,
  existing approaches to estimating uncertainty largely ignore the possibility of
  covariate shiftâ€”i.e.,where the real-world data distribution may differ from the
  training distribution.  As a consequence, existing algorithms can overestimate certainty,
  possibly yielding a false sense of confidence in the predictive model. We pro-pose
  an algorithm for calibrating predictions that accounts for the possibility of covariate
  shift, given labeled examples from the train-ing distribution and unlabeled examples
  from the real-world distribution. Our algorithm uses importance weighting to correct
  for the shift from the training to the real-world distribution. However, importance
  weighting relies on the training and real-world distributions to be sufficiently
  close. Building on ideas from domain adaptation, we additionally learn a feature
  map that tries to equalize these two distributions. In an empirical evaluation,
  we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing approaches to calibrated
  prediction when there is covariate shift.
