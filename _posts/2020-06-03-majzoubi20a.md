title: 'LdSM: Logarithm-depth Streaming Multi-label Decision Trees'
abstract: " We consider multi-label classification where the goal is to annotate each
  data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label
  set. Efficient annotation can be achieved with balanced tree predictors, i.e. trees
  with logarithmic-depth in the label complexity, whose leaves correspond to labels.
  Designing prediction mechanism with such trees for real data applications is non-trivial
  as it needs to accommodate sending examples to multiple leaves while at the same
  time sustain high prediction accuracy. In this paper we develop the LdSM algorithm
  for the construction and training of multi-label decision trees, where in every
  node of the tree we optimize a novel objective function that favors balanced splits,
  maintains high class purity of children nodes, and allows sending examples to multiple
  directions but with a penalty that prevents tree over-growth. Each node of the tree
  is trained once the previous node is completed leading to a streaming approach for
  training. We analyze the proposed objective theoretically and show that minimizing
  it leads to pure and balanced data splits. Furthermore, we show a boosting theorem
  that captures its connection to the multi-label classification error. Experimental
  results  on benchmark data sets demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction
  accuracy and low prediction time and position LdSM as a competitive tool among existing
  state-of-the-art approaches. "
