title: 'Bisect and Conquer: Hierarchical Clustering via Max-Uncut Bisection'
abstract: Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised data   analysis   method   which   has   been
  widely used for decades.  Despite its popularity, it had an underdeveloped analytical
  foundation and to address this,  Dasgupta recently introduced an optimization viewpoint  of  hierarchical  clustering  with  pairwise
  similarity information that spurred a line  of  work  shedding  light  on  old  algorithms  (e.g.,  Average-Linkage),  but  also
  designing  new  algorithms.   Here,  for  the maximization  dual  of  Dasguptaâ€™s  objective  (introduced  by  Moseley-Wang),   we
  present  polynomial-time  42.46%  approximation  algorithms  that  use Max-Uncut
  Bisection as  a  subroutine.    The  previous  best  worst-case  approximation  factor
  in  polynomial  time was 33.6%,  improving only  slightly  over  Average-Linkage  which
  achieves  33.3%.   Finally,  we  complement our  positive  results  by  providing  APX-hardness
  (even for 0-1 similarities),  under the Small Set Expansion hypothesis.
