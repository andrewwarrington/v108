title: 'Causal Mosaic: Cause-Effect Inference via Nonlinear ICA and Ensemble Method'
abstract: We address the problem of distinguishing cause from effect in bivariate
  setting. Based on recent developments in nonlinear independent component analysis
  (ICA), we train general nonlinear causal models that are implemented by neural networks
  and allow non-additive noise. Further, we build an ensemble framework, namely Causal
  Mosaic, which models a causal pair by a mixture of nonlinear models. We compare
  this method with other recent methods on artificial and real world benchmark datasets,
  and our method shows state-of-the-art performance.
