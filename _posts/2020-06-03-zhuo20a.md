title: Communication-Efficient Asynchronous Stochastic Frank-Wolfe over Nuclear-norm
  Balls
abstract: 'Large-scale machine learning training suffers from two prior challenges,
  specifically for nuclear-norm constrained problems with distributed systems: the
  synchronization slowdown due to the straggling workers, and high communication costs.
  In this work, we propose an asynchronous Stochastic Frank Wolfe (SFW-asyn) method,
  which, for the first time, solves the two problems simultaneously, while successfully
  maintaining the same convergence rate as the vanilla SFW. We implement our algorithm
  in python (with MPI) to run on Amazon EC2, and demonstrate that SFW-asyn yields
  speed-ups almost linear to the number of machines compared to the vanilla SFW.'
