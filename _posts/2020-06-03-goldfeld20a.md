title: 'Gaussian-Smoothed Optimal Transport: Metric Structure and Statistical Efficiency'
abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT), and in particular the Wasserstein distance, has
  seen a surge of interest and applications in machine learning. However, empirical
  approximation under Wasserstein distances suffers from a severe curse of dimensionality,
  rendering them impractical in high dimensions. As a result, entropically regularized
  OT has become a popular workaround. However, while it enjoys fast algorithms and
  better statistical properties, it looses the metric structure that Wasserstein distances
  enjoy. This work proposes a novel Gaussian-smoothed OT (GOT) framework, that achieves
  the best of both worlds: preserving the 1-Wasserstein metric structure while alleviating
  the empirical approximation curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, as the Gaussian-smoothing
  parameter shrinks to zero, GOT $\Gamma$-converges towards classic OT (with convergence
  of optimizers), thus serving as a natural extension. An empirical study that validates
  the theoretical results is provided, promoting Gaussian-smoothed OT as a powerful
  alternative to entropic OT.'
