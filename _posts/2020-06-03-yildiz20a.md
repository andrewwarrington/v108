title: Fast and Accurate Ranking Regression
abstract: We consider a ranking regression problem in which we use a dataset of ranked
  choices to learn Plackett-Luce scores as functions of sample features. We solve
  the maximum likelihood estimation problem by using the Alternating Directions Method
  of Multipliers (ADMM), effectively separating the learning of scores and model parameters.
  This separation allows us to  express scores as the stationary distribution of a
  continuous-time Markov Chain. Using this equivalence, we propose two spectral algorithms
  for ranking regression that learn model parameters up to 579 times faster than the
  Newtonâ€™s method.
