title: 'A Farewell to Arms: Sequential Reward Maximization on a Budget with a Giving
  Up Option'
abstract: We consider a sequential decision-making problem where an agent can take
  one action at a time and each action has a stochastic temporal extent, i.e., a new
  action cannot be taken until the previous one is finished. Upon completion, the
  chosen action yields a stochastic reward. The agent seeks to maximize its cumulative
  reward over a finite time budget, with the option of "giving up" on a current action
  —  hence forfeiting any reward – in order to choose another action. We cast this
  problem as a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem with stochastic
  consumption of resource. For this problem, we first establish that the optimal arm
  is the one that maximizes the ratio of the expected reward of the arm to the expected
  waiting time before the agent sees the reward due to pulling that arm. Using a novel
  upper confidence bound on this ratio, we then introduce an upper confidence based-algorithm,
  WAIT-UCB, for which we establish logarithmic, problem-dependent regret bound which
  has an improved dependence on problem parameters compared to previous works. Simulations
  on various problem configurations comparing WAIT-UCB against the state-of-the-art
  algorithms are also presented.
