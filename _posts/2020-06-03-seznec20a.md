title: A single algorithm for both restless and rested rotting bandits
abstract: In many application domains (e.g., recommender systems, intelligent tutoring
  systems), the rewards associated to the available actions tend to decrease over
  time. This decay is either caused by the actions executed in the past (e.g., a user
  may get bored when songs of the same genre are recommended over and over) or by
  an external factor (e.g., content becomes outdated). These two situations can be
  modeled as specific instances of the rested and restless bandit settings, where
  arms are rotting (i.e., their value decrease over time). These problems were thought
  to be significantly different, since Levine et al. (2017) showed that state-of-the-art
  algorithms for restless bandit perform poorly in the rested rotting setting. In
  this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm, Rotting Adaptive Window UCB (RAW-UCB),
  that achieves near-optimal regret in both rotting rested and restless bandit, without
  any prior knowledge of the setting (rested or restless) and the type of non-stationarity
  (e.g., piece-wise constant, bounded variation). This is in striking contrast with
  previous negative results showing that no algorithm can achieve similar results
  as soon as rewards are allowed to increase. We confirm our theoretical findings
  on a number of synthetic and dataset-based experiments.
