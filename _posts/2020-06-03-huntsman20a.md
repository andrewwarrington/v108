title: Fast Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms via Lie groups
abstract: From basic considerations of the Lie group that preserves a target probability
  measure, we derive the Barker, Metropolis, and ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo
  (MCMC) algorithms, as well as variants of waste-recycling Metropolis-Hastings and
  an altogether new MCMC algorithm. We illustrate these constructions with explicit
  numerical computations, and we empirically demonstrate on a spin glass that the
  new algorithm converges more quickly than its siblings.
