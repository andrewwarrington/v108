title: Neighborhood Growth Determines Geometric Priors for Relational Representation
  Learning
abstract: The problem of identifying geometric structure in heterogeneous, high-dimensional
  data is a cornerstone of representation learning. While there exists a large body
  of literature on the embeddability of canonical graphs, such as lattices or trees,
  the heterogeneity of the relational data typically encountered in practice limits
  the applicability of these classical methods. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial
  approach to evaluating embeddability, i.e., to decide whether a data set is best
  represented in Euclidean, Hyperbolic or Spherical space. Our method analyzes nearest-neighbor
  structures and local neighborhood growth rates to identify the geometric priors
  of suitable embedding spaces. For canonical graphs, the algorithm’s prediction provably
  matches classical results. As for large, heterogeneous graphs, we introduce an efficiently
  computable statistic that approximates the algorithm’s decision rule. We validate
  our method over a range of benchmark data sets and compare with recently published
  optimization-based embeddability methods.
