title: Optimal Algorithms for Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: The paper addresses various Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problems,
  where M decision-makers, or players, collaborate to maximize their cumulative reward.
  We first investigate the MMAB problem where players selecting the same arms experience
  a collision (and are aware of it) and do not collect any reward. For this problem,
  we present DPE1 (Decentralized Parsimonious Exploration), a decentralized algorithm
  that achieves the same asymptotic regret as that obtained by an optimal centralized
  algorithm. DPE1 is simpler than the state-of-the-art algorithm SIC-MMAB Boursier
  and Perchet (2019), and yet offers better performance guarantees. We then study
  the MMAB problem without collision, where players may select the same arm. Players
  sit on vertices of a graph, and in each round, they are able to send a message to
  their neighbours in the graph. We present DPE2, a simple and asymptotically optimal
  algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm DD- UCB Martinez-Rubio
  et al. (2019). Besides, under DPE2, the expected number of bits transmitted by the
  players in the graph is finite.
