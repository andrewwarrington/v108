title: Practical Nonisotropic Monte Carlo Sampling in High Dimensions via Determinantal
  Point Processes
abstract: We propose a new class of practical structured methods for nonisotropic
  Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, called DPPMC, designed for high-dimensional nonisotropic
  distributions where samples are correlated to reduce the variance of the estimator
  via determinantal point processes. We successfully apply DPPMCs to high-dimensional
  problems involving nonisotropic distributions arising in guided evolution strategy
  (GES) methods for reinforcement learning (RL), CMA-ES techniques and trust region
  algorithms for blackbox optimization, improving state-of-the-art in all these settings.
  In particular, we show that DPPMCs drastically improve exploration profiles of the
  existing evolution strategy algorithms. We further confirm our results, analyzing
  random feature map estimators for Gaussian mixture kernels. We provide theoretical
  justification of our empirical results, showing a connection between DPPMCs and
  recently introduced structured orthogonal MC methods for isotropic distributions.
