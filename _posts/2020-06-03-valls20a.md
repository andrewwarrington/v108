title: 'Online Convex Optimization with Perturbed Constraints: Optimal Rates against
  Stronger Benchmarks'
abstract: 'This paper studies Online Convex Optimization (OCO) problems where the
  constraints have additive perturbations that (i) vary over time and (ii) are not
  known at the time to make a decision. Perturbations may not be i.i.d. generated
  and can be used, for example, to model a time-varying budget or time-varying requests
  in resource allocation problems. Our goal is to design a policy that obtains sublinear
  regret and satisfies the constraints in the long-term. To this end, we present an
  online primal-dual proximal gradient algorithm that has $O(T^\epsilon \vee T^{1-\epsilon})$
  regret and $O(T^\epsilon)$ constraint violation, where $\epsilon \in [0,1)$ is a
  parameter in the learning rate. The proposed algorithm obtains optimal rates when
  $\epsilon = 1/2$, and can compare against a stronger comparator (the set of fixed
  decisions in hindsight) than previous work. '
