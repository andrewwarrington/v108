title: Additive Tree-Structured Covariance Function for Conditional Parameter Spaces
  in Bayesian Optimization
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient global optimization algorithm
  for black-box functions which are expensive to evaluate. Existing literature on
  model based optimization in conditional parameter spaces are usually built on trees.
  In this work, we generalize the additive assumption to tree-structured functions
  and propose an additive tree-structured covariance function, showing improved sample-efficiency,
  wider applicability and greater flexibility. Furthermore, by incorporating the structure
  information of parameter spaces and the additive assumption in the BO loop, we develop
  a parallel algorithm to optimize the acquisition function and this optimization
  can be performed in a low dimensional space. We demonstrate our method on an optimization
  benchmark function, as well as on a neural network model compression problem, and
  experimental results show our approach significantly outperforms the current state
  of the art for conditional parameter optimization including SMAC, TPE and Jenatton
  et al. (2017).
