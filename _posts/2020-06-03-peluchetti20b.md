title: Stable behaviour of infinitely wide deep neural networks
abstract: We consider fully connected feed-forward deep neural networks (NNs) where
  weights and biases are independent and identically distributed as symmetric centered
  stable distributions. Then, we show that the infinite wide limit of the NN, under
  suitable scaling on the weights, is a stochastic process whose finite-dimensional
  distributions are multivariate stable distributions. The limiting process is referred
  to as the stable process, and it generalizes the class of Gaussian processes recently
  obtained as infinite wide limits of NNs (Matthews at al., 2018b). Parameters of
  the stable process can be computed via an explicit recursion over the layers of
  the network. Our result contributes to the theory of fully connected feed-forward
  deep NNs, and it paves the way to expand recent lines of research that rely on Gaussian
  infinite wide limits.
