title: 'On Random Subsampling of Gaussian Process Regression: A Graphon-Based Analysis'
abstract: In this paper, we study random subsampling of Gaussian process regression,
  one of the simplest approximation baselines, from a theoretical perspective. Although
  subsampling discards a large part of training data, we show provable guarantees
  on the accuracy of the predictive mean/variance and its generalization ability.For
  analysis, we consider embedding kernel matrices into graphons, which encapsulate
  the difference of the sample size and enables us to evaluate the approximation and
  generalization errors in a unified manner. The experimental results show that the
  subsampling approximation achieves a better trade-off regarding accuracy and runtime
  than the ystrom and random Fourier expansion methods.
