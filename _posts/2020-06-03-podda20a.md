title: A Deep Generative Model for Fragment-Based Molecule Generation
abstract: 'Molecule generation is a challenging open problem in cheminformatics. Currently,
  deep generative approaches addressing the challenge belong to two broad categories,
  differing in how molecules are represented. One approach encodes molecular graphs
  as strings of text, and learns their corresponding character-based language model.
  Another, more expressive, approach operates directly on the molecular graph. In
  this work, we address two limitations of the former: generation of invalid and duplicate
  molecules. To improve validity rates, we develop a language model for small molecular
  substructures called fragments, loosely inspired by the well-known paradigm of Fragment-Based
  Drug Design. In other words, we generate molecules fragment by fragment, instead
  of atom by atom. To improve uniqueness rates, we present a frequency-based masking
  strategy that helps generate molecules with infrequent fragments. We show experimentally
  that our model largely outperforms other language model-based competitors, reaching
  state-of-the-art performances typical of graph-based approaches. Moreover, generated
  molecules display  molecular properties similar to those in the training sample,
  even in absence of explicit task-specific supervision.'
