title: Robust Optimisation Monte Carlo
abstract: 'This paper is on Bayesian inference for parametric statistical models that
  are defined by a stochastic simulator which specifies how data is generated. Exact
  sampling is then possible but evaluating the likelihood function is typically prohibitively
  expensive. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework to perform approximate
  inference in such situations. While basic ABC algorithms are widely applicable,
  they are notoriously slow and much research has focused on increasing their efficiency.
  Optimisation Monte Carlo (OMC) has recently been proposed as an efficient and embarrassingly
  parallel method that leverages optimisation to accelerate the inference. In this
  paper, we demonstrate an important previously unrecognised failure mode of OMC:
  It generates strongly overconfident approximations by collapsing regions of similar
  or near-constant likelihood into a single point. We propose an efficient, robust
  generalisation of OMC that corrects this. It makes fewer assumptions, retains the
  main benefits of OMC, and can be performed either as post-processing to OMC or as
  a stand-alone computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Robust
  OMC on toy examples and tasks in inverse-graphics where we perform Bayesian inference
  with a complex image renderer.'
