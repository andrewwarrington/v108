title: Regularization via Structural Label Smoothing
abstract: Regularization is an effective way to promote the generalization performance
  of machine learning models. In this paper, we focus on label smoothing, a form of
  output distribution regularization that prevents overfitting of a neural network
  by softening the ground-truth labels in the training data in an attempt to penalize
  overconfident outputs. Existing approaches typically use cross-validation to impose
  this smoothing, which is uniform across all training data. In this paper, we show
  that such label smoothing imposes a quantifiable bias in the Bayes error rate of
  the training data, with regions of the feature space with high overlap and low marginal
  likelihood having a lower bias and regions of low overlap and high marginal likelihood
  having a higher bias. These theoretical results motivate a simple objective function
  for data-dependent smoothing to mitigate the potential negative consequences of
  the operation while maintaining its desirable properties as a regularizer. We call
  this approach Structural Label Smoothing (SLS). We implement SLS and empirically
  validate on synthetic, Higgs, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. The results
  confirm our theoretical insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  method in comparison to traditional label smoothing.
