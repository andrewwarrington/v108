title: Minimax Testing of Identity to a Reference Ergodic Markov Chain
abstract: We exhibit an efficient procedure for testing, based on a single long state
  sequence, whether an unknown Markov chain is identical to or e-far from a given
  reference chain. We obtain nearly matching (up to logarithmic factors) upper and
  lower sample complexity bounds for our notion of distance, which is based on total
  variation. Perhaps surprisingly, we discover that the sample complexity depends
  solely on the properties of the known reference chain and does not involve the unknown
  chain at all, which is not even assumed to be ergodic.
