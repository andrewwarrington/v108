title: Nonmyopic Gaussian Process Optimization with Macro-Actions
abstract: This paper presents a multi-staged approach to nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian
  process optimization (GPO) for Bayesian optimization (BO) of unknown, highly complex
  objective functions that, in contrast to existing nonmyopic adaptive BO algorithms,
  exploits the notion of macro-actions for scaling up to a further lookahead to match
  up to a larger available budget. To achieve this, we generalize GP upper confidence
  bound to a new acquisition function defined w.r.t. a nonmyopic adaptive macro-action
  policy, which is intractable to be optimized exactly due to an uncountable set of
  candidate outputs. The contribution of our work here is thus to derive a nonmyopic
  adaptive epsilon-Bayes-optimal macro-action GPO (epsilon-Macro-GPO) policy. To perform
  nonmyopic adaptive BO in real time, we then propose an asymptotically optimal anytime
  variant of our epsilon-Macro-GPO policy with a performance guarantee. We empirically
  evaluate the performance of our epsilon-Macro-GPO policy and its anytime variant
  in BO with synthetic and real-world datasets.
