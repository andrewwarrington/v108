title: Nested-Wasserstein Self-Imitation Learning for Sequence Generation
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied for improving sequence-generation
  models. However, the conventional rewards used for RL training typically cannot
  capture sufficient semantic information and therefore render model bias. Further,
  the sparse and delayed rewards make RL exploration inefficient. To alleviate these
  issues, we propose the concept of nested-Wasserstein distance for distributional
  semantic matching. To further exploit it, a novel nested-Wasserstein self-imitation
  learning framework is developed, encouraging the model to exploit historical high-rewarded
  sequences for enhanced exploration and better semantic matching. Our solution can
  be understood as approximately executing proximal policy optimization with Wasserstein
  trust-regions. Experiments on a variety of unconditional and conditional sequence-generation
  tasks demonstrate the proposed approach consistently leads to improved performance.
