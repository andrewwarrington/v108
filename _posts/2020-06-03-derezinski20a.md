title: Bayesian experimental design using regularized determinantal point processes
abstract: 'We establish a fundamental connection between Bayesian experimental design
  and determinantal point processes (DPPs). Experimental design is a classical task
  in combinatorial optimization, where we wish to select a small subset of $d$-dimensional
  vectors to minimize a statistical optimality criterion. We show that a new regularized
  variant of DPPs can be used to design efficient algorithms for finding $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
  solutions to experimental design under four commonly used optimality criteria: A-,
  C-, D- and V-optimality. A key novelty is that we offer improved guarantees under
  the Bayesian framework, where prior knowledge is incorporated into the criteria.
  Our algorithm returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution when the subset size
  $k$ is $\Omega\left(\frac{d_A}{\epsilon} + \frac{\log(11/epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}\right)$,
  where $d_A << d$ is an effective dimension determined by prior knowledge (via a
  precision matrix $\mathbf{A}$).This is the first approximation guarantee where the
  dependence on $d$ is replaced by an effective dimension. Moreover, the time complexity
  of our algorithm significantly improves on existing approaches with comparable guarantees.'
