title: Inference of Dynamic Graph Changes for Functional Connectome
abstract: 'Dynamic functional connectivity is an effective measure for the brainâ€™s
  responses to continuous stimuli. We propose an inferential method to detect the
  dynamic changes of brain networks based on time-varying graphical models. Whereas
  most existing methods focus on testing the existence of change points, the dynamics
  in the brain network offer more signals in many neuroscience studies. We propose
  a novel method to conduct hypothesis testing on changes in dynamic brain networks.
  We introduce a bootstrap statistic to approximate the supreme of the high-dimensional
  empirical processes over dynamically changing edges. Our simulations show that this
  framework can capture the change points with changed connectivity. Finally, we apply
  our method to a brain imaging dataset under a natural audio-video stimulus and illustrate
  that we are able to detect temporal changes in brain networks. The functions of
  the identified regions are consistent with specific emotional annotations, which
  are closely associated with changes inferred by our method. '
