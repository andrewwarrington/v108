title: Diameter-based Interactive Structure Discovery
abstract: We introduce interactive structure discovery, a generic framework that encompasses
  many interactive learning settings, including active learning, top-k item identification,
  interactive drug discovery, and others. We adapt a recently developed active learning
  algorithm of Tosh and Dasgupta for interactive structure discovery, and show that
  the new algorithm can be made noise-tolerant and enjoys favorable query complexity
  bounds.
