title: Finite-Time Error Bounds for Biased Stochastic Approximation with Applications
  to Q-Learning
abstract: 'Inspired by the widespread use of Q-learning algorithms in reinforcement
  learning (RL), this present paper studies a class of  biased stochastic approximation
  (SA) procedures under an ‘ergodic-like’ assumption on the underlying stochastic
  noise sequence. Leveraging a \emph{multistep Lyapunov function} that looks ahead
  to several future updates to accommodate the gradient bias, we prove a general result
  on the convergence of the iterates, and use it to derive finite-time bounds on the
  mean-square error in the case of constant stepsizes. This novel viewpoint renders
  the finite-time analysis of \emph{biased SA} algorithms under a broad family of
  stochastic perturbations possible. For direct comparison with past works, we also
  demonstrate these bounds by applying them to Q-learning with linear function approximation,
  under the realistic Markov chain observation model. The resultant finite-time error
  bound for Q-learning is \emph{the first of its kind}, in the sense that it holds:
  i) for the unmodified version (i.e., without making any modifications to the updates),
  and ii), for Markov chains starting from any initial distribution, at least one
  of which has to be violated for existing results to be applicable.  '
