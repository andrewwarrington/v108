title: Efficient Planning under Partial Observability with Unnormalized Q Functions
  and Spectral Learning
abstract: 'Learning and planning in partially-observable domains is one of the most
  difficult problems in reinforcement learning. Traditional methods consider these
  two problems as independent, resulting in a classic two-stage paradigm: first learn
  the environment dynamics and then compute the optimal policy accordingly. This approach,
  however, disconnects the reward information from the learning of the environment
  model and can consequently lead to representations that are sample inefficient and
  time consuming for planning purpose. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
  that incorporate reward information into the representations of the environment
  to unify these two stages. Our algorithm is closely related to the spectral learning
  algorithm for predicitive state representations and offers appealing theoretical
  guarantees and time complexity. We empirically show on two domains that our approach
  is more sample  and time efficient compared to  classical methods.'
