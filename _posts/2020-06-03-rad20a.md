title: Error bounds in estimating the out-of-sample prediction error using leave-one-out
  cross validation in high-dimensions
abstract: We study the problem of out-of-sample risk estimation in the high dimensional
  regime where both the sample size $n$ and number of features $p$ are large, and
  $n/p$ can be less than one. Extensive empirical evidence confirms the accuracy of
  leave-one-out cross validation (LO) for out-of-sample risk estimation. Yet, a unifying
  theoretical evaluation of the accuracy of LO in high-dimensional problems has remained
  an open problem. This paper aims to fill this gap for penalized regression in the
  generalized linear family. With minor assumptions about the data generating process,
  and without any sparsity assumptions on the regression coefficients, our theoretical
  analysis obtains finite sample upper bounds on the expected squared error of LO
  in estimating the out-of-sample error. Our bounds show that the error goes to zero
  as $n,p \rightarrow \infty$, even when the dimension $p$ of the feature vectors
  is comparable with or  greater than the sample size $n$. One technical advantage
  of the theory is that it can be used to clarify and connect some results from the
  recent literature on  scalable approximate LO.
