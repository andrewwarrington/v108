title: Invertible Generative Modeling using Linear Rational Splines
abstract: Normalizing flows attempt to model an arbitrary probability distribution
  through a set of invertible mappings. These transformations are required to achieve
  a tractable Jacobian determinant that can be used in high-dimensional scenarios.
  The first normalizing flow designs used coupling layer mappings built upon affine
  transformations. The significant advantage of such models is their easy-to-compute
  inverse. Nevertheless, making use of affine transformations may limit the expressiveness
  of such models. Recently, invertible piecewise polynomial functions as a replacement
  for affine transformations have attracted attention. However, these methods require
  solving a polynomial equation to calculate their inverse. In this paper, we explore
  using linear rational splines as a replacement for affine transformations used in
  coupling layers. Besides having a straightforward inverse, inference and generation
  have similar cost and architecture in this method. Moreover, simulation results
  demonstrate the competitiveness of this approachâ€™s performance compared to existing
  methods.
