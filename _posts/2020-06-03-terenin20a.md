title: Asynchronous Gibbs Sampling
abstract: Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method often used in
  Bayesian learning. MCMC methods can be difficult to deploy on parallel and distributed
  systems due to their inherently sequential nature. We study asynchronous Gibbs sampling,
  which achieves parallelism by simply ignoring sequential requirements. This method
  has been shown to produce good empirical results for some hierarchical models, and
  is popular in the topic modeling community, but was also shown to diverge for other
  targets. We introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing asynchronous Gibbs sampling
  and other extensions of MCMC that do not possess the Markov property. We prove that
  asynchronous Gibbs can be modified so that it converges under appropriate regularity
  conditions - we call this the exact asynchronous Gibbs algorithm. We study asynchronous
  Gibbs on a set of examples by comparing the exact and approximate algorithms, including
  two where it works well, and one where it fails dramatically. We conclude with a
  set of heuristics to describe settings where the algorithm can be effectively used.
