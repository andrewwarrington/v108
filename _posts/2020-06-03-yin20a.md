title: A Theoretical Case Study of Structured Variational Inference for Community
  Detection
abstract: Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) has been widely applied in large
  scale Bayesian inference. However, MFVI assumes independent distribution on the
  latent variables, which often leads to objective functions with many local optima,
  making optimization algorithms sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we study
  the advantage of  structured variational inference in the context of the two-class
  Stochastic Blockmodel. To facilitate theoretical analysis, the variational distribution
  is constructed to have a simple pairwise dependency structure on the nodes of the
  network.  We prove that, in a broad density regime and for general random initializations,
  unlike MFVI,  the estimated class labels by structured VI converge to the ground
  truth with high probability, when the model parameters are known, estimated within
  a reasonable range or jointly optimized with the variational parameters. In addition,
  empirically we demonstrate structured VI is more robust compared with MFVI when
  the graph is sparse and the signal to noise ratio is low. The paper takes a first
  step towards understanding the importance of dependency structure in variational
  inference for community detection.
