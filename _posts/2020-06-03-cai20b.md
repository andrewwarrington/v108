title: Solving the Robust Matrix Completion Problem via  a System of Nonlinear Equations
abstract: We consider the problem of robust matrix completion, which aims to recover
  a low rank matrix $L_*$ and a sparse matrix $S_*$ from incomplete observations of
  their sum $M=L_*+S_*\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$.Algorithmically, the robust matrix
  completion problem is transformed into a problem of solving a system of nonlinear
  equations,and the alternative direction method is then used to solve the nonlinear
  equations.In addition, the algorithm is highly parallelizable and suitable for large
  scale problems.Theoretically, we characterize the sufficient conditions for when
  $L_*$ can be approximated by a low rank approximation of the observed $M_*$.And
  under proper assumptions, it is shown that the algorithm converges to the true solution
  linearly.Numerical simulations show that the simple method works as expected and
  is comparable with state-of-the-art methods.
