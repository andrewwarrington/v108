title: 'RCD: Repetitive causal discovery of linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with
  latent confounders'
abstract: Causal discovery from data affected by latent confounders is an important
  and difficult challenge. Causal functional model-based approaches have not been
  used to present variables whose relationships are affected by latent confounders,
  while some constraint-based methods can present them. This paper proposes a causal
  functional model-based method called repetitive causal discovery (RCD) to discover
  the causal structure of observed variables affected by latent confounders. RCD repeats
  inferring the causal directions between a small number of observed variables and
  determines whether the relationships are affected by latent confounders. RCD finally
  produces a causal graph where a bi-directed arrow indicates the pair of variables
  that have the same latent confounders, and a directed arrow indicates the causal
  direction of a pair of variables that are not affected by the same latent confounder.
  The results of experimental validation using simulated data and real-world data
  confirmed that RCD is effective in identifying latent confounders and causal directions
  between observed variables.
