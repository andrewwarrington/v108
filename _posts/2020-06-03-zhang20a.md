title: Minimizing Dynamic Regret and Adaptive Regret Simultaneously
abstract: Regret minimization is treated as the golden rule in the traditional study
  of online learning. However, regret minimization algorithms tend to converge to
  the static optimum, thus being suboptimal for changing environments. To address
  this limitation, new performance measures, including dynamic regret and adaptive
  regret have been proposed to guide the design of online algorithms. The former one
  aims to minimize the global regret with respect to a sequence of changing comparators,
  and the latter one attempts to minimize every local regret with respect to a fixed
  comparator. Existing algorithms for dynamic regret and adaptive regret are developed
  independently, and only target one performance measure. In this paper, we bridge
  this gap by proposing novel online algorithms that are able to minimize the dynamic
  regret and adaptive regret simultaneously. In fact, our theoretical guarantee is
  even stronger in the sense that one algorithm is able to minimize the dynamic regret
  over any interval.
