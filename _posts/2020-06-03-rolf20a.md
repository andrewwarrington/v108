title: 'Post-Estimation Smoothing: A Simple Baseline for Learning with Side Information'
abstract: 'Observational data are often accompanied by natural structural indices,
  such as time stamps or geographic locations, which are meaningful to prediction
  tasks but are often discarded. We leverage semantically meaningful indexing data
  while ensuring robustness to potentially uninformative or misleading indices. We
  propose a post-estimation smoothing operator as a fast and effective method for
  incorporating structural index data into prediction. Because the smoothing step
  is separate from the original predictor, it applies to a broad class of machine
  learning tasks, with no need to retrain models. Our theoretical analysis details
  simple conditions under which post-estimation smoothing will improve accuracy over
  that of the original predictor. Our experiments on large scale spatial and temporal
  datasets highlight the speed and accuracy of post-estimation smoothing in practice.
  Together, these results illuminate a novel way to consider and incorporate the natural
  structure of index variables in machine learning. '
