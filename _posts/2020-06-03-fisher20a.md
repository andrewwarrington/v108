title: A Locally Adaptive Bayesian Cubature Method
abstract: 'Bayesian cubature (BC) is a popular inferential perspective on the cubature
  of expensive integrands, wherein the integrand is emulated using a stochastic process
  model. Several approaches have been put forward to encode sequential adaptation
  (i.e. dependence on previous integrand evaluations) into this framework. However,
  these proposals have been limited to either estimating the parameters of a stationary
  covariance model or focusing computational resources on regions where large values
  are taken by the integrand. In contrast, many classical adaptive cubature methods
  are locally adaptive in the sense that they focus computational resources on spatial
  regions in which local error estimates are largest. The main contributions of this
  work are twofold; first we establish that existing BC methods do not possess local
  adaptivity in the sense of many classical adaptive methods and secondly, we developed
  a novel BC method whose behaviour, demonstrated empirically, is analogous to such
  methods. Finally we present evidence that the novel method provides improved cubature
  performance, relative to standard BC, in a detailed empirical assessment. '
