title: Online Continuous DR-Submodular Maximization with Long-Term Budget Constraints
abstract: In this paper, we study a class of online optimization problems with long-term
  budget constraints where the objective functions are not necessarily concave (nor
  convex), but they instead satisfy the Diminishing Returns (DR) property. In this
  online setting, a sequence of monotone DR-submodular objective functions and linear
  budget functions arrive over time and assuming a limited total budget, the goal
  is to take actions at each time, before observing the utility and budget function
  arriving at that round, to achieve sub-linear regret bound while the total budget
  violation is sub-linear as well. Prior work has shown that achieving sub-linear
  regret and total budget violation simultaneously is impossible if the utility and
  budget functions are chosen adversarially. Therefore, we modify the notion of regret
  by comparing the agent against the best fixed decision in hindsight which satisfies
  the budget constraint proportionally over any window of length $W$. We propose the
  Online Saddle Point Hybrid Gradient (OSPHG) algorithm to solve this class of online
  problems. For $W=T$, we recover the aforementioned impossibility result. However,
  if $W$ is sub-linear in $T$, we show that it is possible to obtain sub-linear bounds
  for both the regret and the total budget violation.
