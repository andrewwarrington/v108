title: Variational Autoencoders for Sparse and Overdispersed Discrete Data
abstract: 'Many applications, such as text modelling, high-throughput sequencing,
  and recommender systems, require analysing sparse, high-dimensional, and overdispersed
  discrete (count or binary) data. Recent deep probabilistic models based on variational
  autoencoders (VAE) have shown promising results on discrete data but may have inferior
  modelling performance due to the insufficient capability in modelling overdispersion
  and model misspecification. To address these issues, we develop a VAE-based framework
  using the negative binomial distribution as the data distribution. We also provide
  an analysis of its properties vis-Ã -vis other models. We conduct extensive experiments
  on three problems from discrete data analysis: text analysis/topic modelling, collaborative
  filtering, and multi-label learning. Our models outperform state-of-the-art approaches
  on these problems, while also capturing the phenomenon of overdispersion more effectively.'
