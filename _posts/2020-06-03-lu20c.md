title: 'Mitigating Overfitting in Supervised Classification from Two Unlabeled Datasets:
  A Consistent Risk Correction Approach'
abstract: The recently proposed unlabeled-unlabeled (UU) classification method allows
  us to train a binary classifier only from two unlabeled datasets with different
  class priors. Since this method is based on the empirical risk minimization, it
  works as if it is a supervised classification method, compatible with any model
  and optimizer. However, this method sometimes suffers from severe overfitting, which
  we would like to prevent in this paper. Our empirical finding in applying the original
  UU method is that overfitting often co-occurs with the empirical risk going negative,
  which is not legitimate. Therefore, we propose to wrap the terms that cause a negative
  empirical risk by certain correction functions. Then, we prove the consistency of
  the corrected risk estimator and derive an estimation error bound for the corrected
  risk minimizer. Experiments show that our proposal can successfully mitigate overfitting
  of the UU method and significantly improve the classification accuracy.
