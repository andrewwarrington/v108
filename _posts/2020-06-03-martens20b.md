title: 'BasisVAE: Translation-invariant feature-level clustering with Variational
  Autoencoders'
abstract: 'Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a flexible and scalable framework
  for non-linear dimensionality reduction. However, in application domains such as
  genomics where data sets are typically tabular and high-dimensional, a black-box
  approach to dimensionality reduction does not provide sufficient insights. Common
  data analysis workflows additionally use clustering techniques to identify groups
  of similar features. This usually leads to a two-stage process, however, it would
  be desirable to construct a joint modelling framework for simultaneous dimensionality
  reduction and clustering of features. In this paper, we propose to achieve this
  through the BasisVAE: a combination of the VAE and a probabilistic clustering prior,
  which lets us learn a one-hot basis function representation as part of the decoder
  network. Furthermore, for scenarios where not all features are aligned, we develop
  an extension to handle translation-invariant basis functions. We show how a collapsed
  variational inference scheme leads to scalable and efficient inference for BasisVAE,
  demonstrated on various toy examples as well as on single-cell gene expression data. '
