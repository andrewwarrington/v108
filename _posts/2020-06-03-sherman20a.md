title: General Identification of Dynamic Treatment Regimes Under Interference
abstract: In many applied fields, researchers are ofteninterested in tailoring treatments
  to unit-levelcharacteristics in order to optimize an outcomeof interest. Methods
  for identifying andestimating treatment policies are the subjectof the dynamic treatment
  regime literature. Separately, in many settings the assumptionthat data are independent
  and identically distributeddoes not hold due to inter-subjectdependence. The phenomenon
  where a subject’s outcome is dependent on his neighbor’s exposure is known as interference.
  These areasintersect in myriad real-world settings. Inthis paper we consider the
  problem of identifyingoptimal treatment policies in the presenceof interference.
  Using a general representationof interference, via Lauritzen-Wermuth-Freydenburg
  chain graphs (Lauritzen andRichardson, 2002), we formalize a variety ofpolicy interventions
  under interference andextend existing identification theory (Tian,2008; Sherman
  and Shpitser, 2018). Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of policy maximization
  under interference in a simulation study.
