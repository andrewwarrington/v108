title: 'ChemBO: Bayesian Optimization of Small Organic Molecules with Synthesizable
  Recommendations'
abstract: In applications such as molecule design or drug discovery, it is desirable
  to have an algorithm which recommends new candidate molecules based on the results
  of past tests. These molecules first need to be synthesized and then tested for
  objective properties. We describe ChemBO, a Bayesian optimization framework for
  generating and optimizing organic molecules for desired molecular properties. While
  most existing data-driven methods for this problem do not account for sample efficiency
  or fail to enforce realistic constraints on synthesizability, our approach explores
  synthesis graphs in a sample-efficient way and produces synthesizable candidates.
  We implement ChemBO as a Gaussian process model and explore existing molecular kernels
  for it. Moreover, we propose a novel optimal-transport based distance and kernel
  that accounts for graphical information explicitly. In our experiments, we demonstrate
  the efficacy of the proposed approach on several molecular optimization problems.
