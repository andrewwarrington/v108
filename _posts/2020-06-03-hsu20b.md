title: 'Linear Dynamics: Clustering without identification'
abstract: Linear dynamical systems are a fundamental and powerful parametric model
  class. However, identifying the parameters of a linear dynamical system is a venerable
  task, permitting provably efficient solutions only in special cases. This work shows
  that the eigenspectrum of unknown linear dynamics can be identified without full
  system identification. We analyze a computationally efficient and provably convergent
  algorithm to estimate the eigenvalues of the state-transition matrix in a linear
  dynamical system.When applied to time series clustering, our algorithm can efficiently
  cluster multi-dimensional time series with temporal offsets and varying lengths,
  under the assumption that the time series are generated from linear dynamical systems.
  Evaluating our algorithm on both synthetic data and real electrocardiogram (ECG)
  signals, we see improvements in clustering quality over existing baselines.
