title: Why Non-myopic Bayesian Optimization is Promising and How Far Should We Look-ahead?
  A Study via Rollout
abstract: 'Lookahead, also known as non-myopic, Bayesian optimization (BO) aims to
  find optimal sampling policies through solving a dynamic programming (DP) formulation
  that maximizes a long-term reward over a rolling horizon. Though promising, lookahead
  BO faces the risk of error propagation through its increased dependence on a possibly
  mis-specified model. In this work we focus on the rollout approximation for solving
  the intractable DP. We first prove the improving nature of rollout in tackling lookahead
  BO and provide a sufficient condition for the used heuristic to be rollout improving.
  We then provide both a theoretical and practical guideline to decide on the rolling
  horizon stagewise. This guideline is built on quantifying the negative effect of
  a mis-specified model. To illustrate our idea, we provide case studies on both single
  and multi-information source BO. Empirical results show the advantageous properties
  of our method over several myopic and non-myopic BO algorithms. '
