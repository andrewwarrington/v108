title: 'Greed Meets Sparsity: Understanding and Improving Greedy Coordinate Descent
  for Sparse Optimization'
abstract: We consider greedy coordinate descent (GCD) for composite problems with
  sparsity inducing regularizers, including 1-norm regularization and non-negative
  constraints. Empirical evidence strongly suggests that GCD, when initialized with
  the zero vector, has an implicit screening ability that usually selects at each
  iteration coordinates that at are nonzero at the solution. Thus, for problems with
  sparse solutions, GCD can converge significantly faster than randomized coordinate
  descent. We present an improved convergence analysis of GCD for sparse optimization,
  and a formal analysis of its screening properties. We also propose and analyze an
  improved selection rule with stronger ability to produce sparse iterates. Numerical
  experiments on both synthetic and real-world data support our analysis and the effectiveness
  of the proposed selection rule.
