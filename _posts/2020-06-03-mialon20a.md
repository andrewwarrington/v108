title: Screening Data Points in Empirical Risk Minimization via Ellipsoidal Regions
  and Safe Loss Functions
abstract: We design simple screening tests to automatically discard data samples in
  empirical risk minimization withoutlosing optimization guarantees. We derive loss
  functions that produce dual objectives with a sparse solution. We also show how
  to regularize convex losses to ensure such a dual sparsity-inducing property, andpropose
  a general method to design screening tests for classification or regression based
  on ellipsoidal approximations of the optimal set. In addition to producing computational
  gains, our approach also allows us to compress a dataset into a subset of representative
  points.
