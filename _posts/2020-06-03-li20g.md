title: Censored Quantile Regression Forest
abstract: Random forests are powerful non-parametric regression method but are severely
  limited in their usage in the presence of randomly censored observations, and naively
  applied can exhibit poor predictive performance due to the incurred biases. Based
  on a local adaptive representation of random forests, we develop its regression
  adjustment for randomly censored regression quantile models. Regression adjustment
  is based on a new estimating equation that adapts to censoring and leads to quantile
  score whenever the data do not exhibit censoring. The proposed procedure named censored
  quantile regression forest, allows us to estimate quantiles of time-to-event without
  any parametric modeling assumption. We establish its consistency under mild model
  specifications. Numerical studies showcase a clear advantage of the proposed procedure.
