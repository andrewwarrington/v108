title: 'Laplacian-Regularized Graph Bandits: Algorithms and Theoretical Analysis'
abstract: We consider a stochastic linear bandit problem with multiple users, where
  the relationship between users is captured by an underlying graph and user preferences
  are represented as smooth signals on the  graph. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm
  where the smoothness prior is imposed via the random-walk graph Laplacian, which
  leads to a single-user cumulative regret scaling as $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\Psi d
  \sqrt{T})$ with time horizon $T$, feature dimensionality $d$, and the scalar parameter
  $\Psi \in (0,1)$ that depends on the graph connectivity. This is an improvement
  over $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d \sqrt{T})$ in \algo{LinUCB}Â \Ccite{li2010contextual},
  where user relationship is not taken into account.In terms of network regret (sum
  of cumulative regret over $n$ users), the proposed algorithm leads to a scaling
  as $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\Psi d\sqrt{nT})$, which is a significant improvement over
  $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(nd\sqrt{T})$ in the state-of-the-art algorithm \algo{Gob.Lin}
  \Ccite{cesa2013gang}. To improve scalability, we further propose a simplified algorithm
  with a linear computational complexity with respect to the number of users, while
  maintaining the same regret. Finally, we present a finite-time analysis on the proposed
  algorithms, and demonstrate their advantage in comparison with state-of-the-art
  graph-based bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data.
