title: A Simple Approach for Non-stationary Linear Bandits
abstract: 'This paper investigates the problem of non-stationary linear bandits, where
  the unknown regression parameter is evolving over time. Previous studies have adopted
  sophisticated mechanisms, such as sliding window or weighted penalty to achieve
  near-optimal dynamic regret. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple restarted
  strategy is sufficient to attain the same regret guarantee. Specifically, we design
  an UCB-type algorithm to balance exploitation and exploration, and restart it periodically
  to handle the drift of unknown parameters. Let $T$ be the time horizon, $d$ be the
  dimension, and $P_T$ be the path-length that measures the fluctuation of the evolving
  unknown parameter, our approach enjoys an $\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}(1+P_T)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$
  dynamic regret, which is nearly optimal, matching the $\Omega(d^{2/3}(1+P_T)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$
  minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Empirical studies also validate the
  efficacy of our approach. '
