title: Asymptotically Efficient Off-Policy Evaluation for Tabular Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We consider the problem of off-policy evaluation for reinforcement learning,
  where the goal is to estimate the expected reward of a target policy $\pi$ using
  offline data collected by running a logging policy $\mu$.  Standard importance-sampling
  based approaches for this problem suffer from a variance that scales exponentially
  with time horizon $H$, which motivates a splurge of recent interest in alternatives
  that break the "Curse of Horizon" (Liu et al. 2018, Xie et al. 2019). In particular,
  it was shown that a marginalized importance sampling (MIS) approach can be used
  to achieve an estimation error of order $O(H^3/ n)$ in mean square error (MSE) under
  an episodic Markov Decision Process model with finite states and potentially infinite
  actions. The MSE bound however is still a factor of $H$ away from a Cramer-Rao lower
  bound of order  $\Omega(H^2/n)$. In this paper, we prove that with a simple modification
  to the MIS estimator, we can asymptotically attain the Cramer-Rao lower bound, provided
  that the action space is finite. We also provide a general method for constructing
  MIS estimators with high-probability error bounds. '
