title: Distributionally Robust Formulation and Model Selection for the Graphical Lasso
abstract: Building on a recent framework for distributionally robust optimization,
  we consider inverse covariance matrix estimation for multivariate data. A novel
  notion of Wasserstein ambiguity set is provided that is specifically tailored to
  this problem, leading to a tractable class of regularized estimators. Penalized
  likelihood estimators for Gaussian data, specifically the graphical lasso estimator,
  are special cases. Consequently, a direction connection is made between the radius
  of the Wasserstein ambiguity and the regularization parameter, so that the level
  of robustness of the estimator is shown to correspond to the level of confidence
  with which the ambiguity set contains a distribution with the population covariance.
  A unique feature of the formulation is that the radius can be expressed in closed-form
  as a function of the ordinary sample covariance matrix. Taking advantage of this
  finding, a simple algorithm is developed to determine a regularization parameter
  for graphical lasso, using only the bootstrapped sample covariance matrices, rendering
  computationally expensive repeated evaluation of the graphical lasso algorithm unnecessary.
  Alternatively, the distributionally robust formulation can also quantify the robustness
  of the corresponding estimator if one uses an off-the-shelf method such as cross-validation.
  Finally, a numerical study is performed to analyze the robustness of the proposed
  method relative to other automated tuning procedures used in practice.
