title: Enriched mixtures of generalised Gaussian process experts
abstract: Mixtures of experts probabilistically divide the input space into regions,
  where the assumptions of each expert, or conditional model, need only hold locally.
  Combined with Gaussian process (GP) experts, this results in a powerful and highly
  flexible model. We focus on alternative mixtures of GP experts, which  model the
  joint distribution of the inputs and targets explicitly. We highlight issues of
  this approach in multi-dimensional input spaces, namely,  poor scalability and the
  need for an unnecessarily large number of experts, degrading the predictive performance
  and increasing uncertainty. We construct a novel model to address these issues through
  a nested partitioning scheme that automatically infers the number of components
  at both levels. Multiple response types are accommodated through a generalised GP
  framework, while multiple input types are included through a factorised exponential
  family structure. We show the effectiveness of our approach in estimating a parsimonious
  probabilistic description of both  synthetic data of increasing dimension and an
  Alzheimerâ€™s challenge dataset.
