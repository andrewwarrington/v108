title: Minimax Rank-$1$ Matrix Factorization
abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a rank-one matrix when a perturbed
  subset of its entries is revealed. We  propose a method based on least squares in
  the log-space and show its performance matches  the  lower bounds that we derive
  for this problem in the small-perturbation regime,  which are related to the spectral
  gap of a graph representing the revealed entries. Unfortunately, we show that for
  larger disturbances, potentially exponentially growing errors are unavoidable for
  any consistent recovery method. We then propose a second algorithm relying on encoding
  the matrix factorization in the stationary distribution of a certain Markov chain.  We
  show that, under the stronger assumption of known upper and lower bounds on the
  entries of the true matrix,   this second method does not have exponential error
  growth for large disturbances. Both algorithms can be implemented in nearly linear
  time.
