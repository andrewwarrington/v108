title: More Powerful Selective Kernel Tests for Feature Selection
abstract: Refining one’s hypotheses in light of data is a commonplace scientific practice,
  however,this approach introduces selection bias and can lead to specious statisticalanalysis.One
  approach of addressing this phenomena is via  conditioning on the selection procedure,
  i.e., how we have used the data to generate our hypotheses, and prevents information
  to be used again after selection.Many selective inference (a.k.a. post-selection
  inference) algorithms typically take this approach but will “over-condition”for
  sake of tractability. While this practice obtains well calibrated $p$-values,it
  can incur a major loss in power. In our work, we extend two recent proposals for
  selecting features using the Maximum Mean Discrepancyand Hilbert Schmidt Independence
  Criterion to condition on the minimalconditioning event. We show how recent advances
  inmultiscale bootstrap makesthis possible and demonstrate our proposal over a range
  of synthetic and real world experiments.Our results show that our proposed test
  is indeed more powerful in most scenarios.
