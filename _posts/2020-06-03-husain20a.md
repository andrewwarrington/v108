title: Local Differential Privacy for Sampling
abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a leading privacy protection  focused by design
  on individual privacy. In the local model of DP, strong privacy is achieved by privatizing
  each userâ€™s individual data before sending it to an untrusted aggregator for analysis.
  While in recent years local DP has been adopted for practical deployments, most
  research in this area focuses on problems where each individual holds a single data
  record. In many problems of practical interest this assumption is unrealistic since
  nowadays most user-owned devices collect large quantities of data (e.g. pictures,
  text messages, time series). We propose to model this scenario by assuming each
  individual holds a distribution over the space of data records, and develop novel
  local DP methods to sample privately from these distributions. Our main contribution
  is a boosting-based density estimation algorithm for learning samplers that generate
  synthetic data while protecting the underlying distribution of each user with local
  DP. We give approximation guarantees quantifying how well these samplers approximate
  the true distribution. Experimental results against DP kernel density estimation
  and DP GANs displays the quality of our results.
