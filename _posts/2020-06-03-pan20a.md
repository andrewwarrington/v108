title: Interpretable Companions for Black-Box Models
abstract: 'We present an interpretable companion model for any pre-trained black-box
  classifiers. The idea is that for any input, a user can decide to either receive
  a prediction from the black-box model, with high accuracy but no explanations, or
  employ a \emph{companion rule} to obtain an interpretable prediction with slightly
  lower accuracy. The companion model is trained from data and the predictions of
  the black-box model, with the objective combining area under the transparencyâ€“accuracy
  curve and model complexity. Our model provides flexible choices for practitioners
  who face the dilemma of choosing between always using interpretable models and always
  using black-box models for a predictive task, so users can, for any given input,
  take a step back to resort to an interpretable prediction if they find the predictive
  performance satisfying, or stick to the black-box model if the rules are unsatisfying.
  To show the value of companion models, we design a human evaluation on more than
  a hundred people to investigate the tolerable accuracy loss to gain interpretability
  for humans. '
