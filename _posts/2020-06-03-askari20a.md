title: 'Naive Feature Selection: Sparsity in Naive Bayes'
abstract: Due to its linear complexity, naive Bayes classification remains an attractive
  supervised learning method, especially in very large-scale settings. We propose
  a sparse version of naive Bayes, which can be used for feature selection. This leads
  to a combinatorial maximum-likelihood problem, for which we provide an exact solution
  in the case of binary data, or a bound in the multinomial case. We prove that our
  bound becomes tight as the marginal contribution of additional features decreases.
  Both binary and multinomial sparse models are solvable in time almost linear in
  problem size, representing a very small extra relative cost compared to the classical
  naive Bayes. Numerical experiments on text data show that the naive Bayes feature
  selection method is as statistically effective as state-of-the-art feature selection
  methods such as recursive feature elimination, l_1-penalized logistic regression
  and LASSO, while being orders of magnitude faster. For a large data set, having
  more than with 1.6 million training points and about 12 million features, and with
  a non-optimized CPU implementation, our sparse naive Bayes model can be trained
  in less than 15 seconds.
