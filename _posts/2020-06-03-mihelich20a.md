title: A Characterization of Mean Squared Error for Estimator with Bagging
abstract: Bagging can significantly improve the generalization performance of unstable
  machine learning algorithms such as trees or neural networks. Though bagging is
  now widely used in practice and many empirical studies have explored its behavior,
  we still know little about the theoretical properties of bagged predictions. In
  this paper, we theoretically investigate how the bagging method can reduce the Mean
  Squared Error (MSE) when applied on a statistical estimator. First, we prove that
  for any estimator, increasing the number of bagged estimators $N$ in the average
  can only reduce the MSE. This intuitive result, observed empirically and discussed
  in the literature, has not yet been rigorously proved. Second, we focus on the standard
  estimator of variance called unbiased sample variance and we develop an exact analytical
  expression of the MSE for this estimator with bagging.     This allows us to rigorously
  discuss the number of iterations $N$ and the batch size $m$ of the bagging method.
  From this expression, we state that only if the kurtosis of the distribution is
  greater than $\frac{3}{2}$, the MSE of the variance estimator can be reduced with
  bagging. This result is important because it demonstrates that for distribution
  with low kurtosis, bagging can only deteriorate the performance of a statistical
  prediction. Finally, we propose a novel general-purpose algorithm to estimate with
  high precision the variance of a sample.
