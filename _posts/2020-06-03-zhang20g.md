title: 'Quantized Frank-Wolfe: Faster Optimization, Lower Communication,  and Projection
  Free'
abstract: How can we efficiently mitigate the overhead of gradient communications
  in distributed optimization? This problem is at the heart of training scalable machine
  learning models and has been mainly studied in the unconstrained setting. In this
  paper, we propose Quantised Frank-Wolfe (QFW), the first projection free and communication-efficient
  algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems at scale. We consider both
  convex and non-convex objective functions, expressed as a finite-sum or more generally
  a stochastic optimization problem, and provide strong theoretical guarantees on
  the convergence rate of QFW. This is accomplished by proposing novel quantization
  schemes that efficiently compress gradients while controlling the noise variance
  intduced during this process. Finally, we empirically validate the efficiency of
  QFW in terms of communication and the quality of returned solution against natural
  baselines.
